26,Vicinity,IPA - Imperial / Double,65,8.0,"Originally brewed in celebration of the first anniversary of Row 34, our favorite Fort Point oyster bar and craft-beer purveyor, Vicinity highlights a neighborhood collaboration of passion and vision. The beer's appearance is a yellow straw-color, with a significant haze. Heavy citrus aromas of pineapple, orange flesh and mango dance on the nose and palate. The pilsner malt provides a medium body and wraps up each sip with a slight balancing bitterness"
33,Galaxy Dry Hopped Fort Point,Pale Ale - American,45,6.6,"This version of our signature American pale ale is dry hopped with the pungent Galaxy variety. Enticingly hazy and blonde in appearance with frothy carb, the nose erupts with strong citrus, passion fruit, and pineapple aromatics.

47,Launch Beer,Pale Ale - American,68,5.7,"First brewed to commemorate the grand opening our new facility in Canton, MA. This special pale ale signifies a collective milestone for the entire Trillium team.

Featuring Mosaic/Citra in the dry hop and a crisp Pilsner malt backbone, Launch Beer exhibits graceful flavors of orange, a light lime character, hints of melon, and slight pithiness.

We raise a glass to you; the devoted community of supporters who have helped us make our dream a reality"
50,Julius,IPA - American,72,6.8,"Bursting with pungent American hops, Julius - our flagship American IPA - is a bright, juicy beer filled with flavors and aromas of mango, peach, passionfruit, and a melange of citrus juice. A soft, pillowy mouthfeel and rounded bitterness ensure Julius will never tire the palate - a true joy to drink"
51,Haze,IPA - Imperial / Double,90,8.2,"Our Double IPA! We smell a ton of peach on the nose, with complimentary notes of orange and passionfruit. The flavor is similar with a blast of citrus fruit & peach quickly followed by a bounty of tropical fruit. A lingering and pleasant saturated hop oil finish awaits. . . . A real juice bomb of a beer"
52,Green,IPA - American,90,7.5,"Our cross-continental IPA! Made with Australian and American hops, this tropical heavy IPA opens up in the glass with notes of hugely flavorful notes of lemon-lime, pineapple, orange sorbet, and tangerine. It has a soft but pointed bitterness and a rich, velvety mouth feel. Intensely kettle and dry hopped yet balanced and flavorful, Green is a beloved crew favorite here at Tree House"
53,Alter Ego,IPA - American,72,6.8,"Alter Ego is a member of the Julius family, taking the base of Julius and adding a tremendous amount of Mosaic to the dry hop with a kiss of Amarillo. What results is a beer with all the deliciousness of Julius with a pungent additional layer of citrusy complexity. Over time, Alter Ego has become a truly singular member of the Tree House family"
54,Doppelgänger,IPA - Imperial / Double,88,8.2,This beer is an imperial version of Alter Ego. It is intensely kettle and dry hopped to produce a pungent and flavorful Double IPA that is super pleasant to drink. It is simply and easily described as a juicy and dank citrus bomb
56,Sap,IPA - American,80,7.3,"Though originally brewed as a ""Christmas"" beer, this piney IPA, brewed almost exclusively Chinook hops, was so enjoyable we decided to put it into the 'year round' rotation. With it's golden yellow color, rich aroma, and drying body, it's hard to stop drinking this one.

Sap is a deceptively soft beer brimming with distinctive notes of grapefruit, mango, pine, and earthy spice. With waves of diverse flavor, it is perhaps our most complex IPA. It is the result of our uncompromising dedication to fresh, progressive, delightful beer. We hope you enjoy it with laughter, good cheer and in the company of those you love"
57,Bright,IPA - Imperial / Double,75,7.8,"Bright was created to be a clean and elegant showcase for one of our favorite hops - Mosaic! It is crafted with a simple malt bill and fermented with clean American Ale yeast to create a flavor profile that is more a function of its vibrant fresh ingredients than an expression of yeast character. Bright’s aroma is a cornucopia of citrus dank… The taste follows suit with notes of grapefruit, sweet berries, and clementine with a gentle orange rind finish. She is dry, soft, and adequately bittered resulting in a very approachable yet pungent Double IPA"
58,JJJULIUSSS!,IPA - American,75,6.8,"Julius gone wild (not funky wild, like insane hop saturation wild)! For the second special edition of Julius brewed specifically for the third anniversary party, we pushed the level of citrus to the fringes of obscenity through additional kettle and dry hopping with the base Julius hop blend. The result is perhaps the most juicy and delectable creation we have ever made! Preposterous Julius, in the best way imaginable"
59,King Julius,IPA - Imperial / Double,85,8.2,"King Julius is an American Double IPA brewed to be an exceptionally flavorful, juicy, and hop saturated beer while never tiring the palate. Its vivid citrus aromas give way to flavors of orange creamsicle, mango smoothie, and a bounty of fresh tropical fruit. We find it to be supremely soft in the midst of an onslaught of flavor...a beer we are quite proud of"
62,Juice Machine,IPA - Imperial / Double,70,8.2,"Juice Machine was originally devised and brewed to support our very first trip to Extreme Beer Festival in 2014. It is essentially a marriage of the King Julius malt bill with a hopping schedule more intense than than Very Green. The use of Magnum, Columbus, Amarillo, Citra, and Galaxy creates perhaps our most complex beer with unapologetic flavors of mango, creamy orange sorbet, papaya, and passion fruit with wave after wave of juicy hop flavor. In spite of its intensity, it is pillowy soft and drinks like a true pleasure - the embodiment of the Tree House ideal of hoppy beer. Never abrasive or harsh, It is just as enjoyable on the last sip as it is on the first. It is a mess of hop flavor that takes us to a place that few other of our beers do. It’s hop nirvan"
64,Very Hazy,IPA - Imperial / Double,80,8.6,"A kicked up version of Haze, our Double IPA, Very Hazy is a beer that makes us Very Happy! Very Hazy conveys all the beautiful flavors of Haze, but with even greater depth and potency. Pungent grapefruit notes greet your palate while an underlying current of soft tropical fruit dances in the background. Just the right amount of bitterness balances the sweet fruit flavors while a velvety soft mouthfeel make you easily (and dangerously!) forget this one clocks in at 8.6% ABV. A huge and beautiful beer that maintains softness and delicacy"
74,That's What She Said,Stout - Milk / Sweet,28,5.6,"A sneakily complex beer, ""TWSS"" exhibits flavors of milk chocolate, dark roasted coffee, caramel, and even a hint of smoke. It is absolutely loaded with flavor for a 5.6% beer, and the inclusion of Lactose takes the edge off of the dry, roasty notes found in a typical stout. The adult chocolate milk shake. . . with this batch being very chocolate heavy! A beer that is notorious for converting ‘pale’ beer lovers to the dark side"
100,Gertrude's Ghost,IPA - New England / Hazy,24,7.0,Juicy fruit and citrus are dominant in aroma and flavor with low bitterness for dangerously drinkable beer.
109,Buttons the Bear,Stout - Oatmeal,20,6.0,"A rich, roasted character from the roasted barley with a smooth clean finish, this stout also contains flaked oats to give you that full mouth feel. This Oatmeal Stout is coming in at 6% with only 20 IBU"
111,Oktoberfest Marzen,Märzen,16,6.0,"Our Marzen is a traditional, well balanced, malt forward Oktoberfest. We used primarily Pilsen and light caramel grains with Herschbucker Hops."
114,Loaded For Bear,IPA - Imperial / Double,81,9.0,"Loaded for Bear - An Imperial IPA with big hop flavor and a pronounced bitterness. We brewed this IPA with Gambrinus ESB, Honey, Gambrinus Vienna and Pale Crystal malts. We added Amarillo and Fuggle hops that attribute to a balanced nose with fruit and earthy notes"
118,7 West,Bock - Single / Traditional,18,7.0,"Big malt character dominates this wickedly smooth lager. A wickedly smooth lager still nicely balanced with Mittelfruh hops. A favorite of our Brewmaster, Charles. This beer is dangerously drinkable"
120,Hawk Watch,IPA - American,56,7.0,"Big hops is the name of the game for this IPA, but don`t let the hoppy characteristics shy you away from this delicious IPA. Thanks to the addition of Amarillo, this hoppy IPA is a citrus bomb. We paired the Amarillo hops with a new variety of hops straight from Germany, Callista. Calllista hops attribute to the juicy flavor in this IPA. 7% ABV and 56 IB"
121,Well Made IPA,IPA - American,56,7.0,"The classic American IPA is “well-made.” The big hop flavor and floral aroma of ygis brew comes from the generous use of Cascade and Amarillo hops. Easy drinking with a crisp, clean finish that will have you coming back for more"
122,Pumpkin Patches,Pumpkin / Yam Beer,20,5.5,"This is a very approachable pumpkin beer, it is well balanced with just the right amount of homemade pumpkin spice. We received our pumpkins from Great Country Farm in Bluemont, VA and then we roasted the pumpkins with brown sugar"
123,Steep Slopes,IPA - American,40,7.0,"The slight reddish hue comes from the use of Red X, a relatively new malt from Germany. The us of Simcoe hops smooths out the pronounced piney character from the generous dose of Centennial hops. This brew has big hop characteristics without an overwhelming bitterness"
125,2 Hopper,IPA - American,67,6.4,"What looks like an easy play turns into trouble when the ball makes a few extra hops than the fielder intended. The 2 Hopper has just enough hops for an IPA, but still has an easy finish to make the out"
126,Knuckle Bock,Bock - Single / Traditional,20,6.5,We bet you didn’t see this one coming. This is a one-of-a-kind bock that’s packed full of rich flavors yet is surprisingly smooth. Baffle your friends when you hand them a Knuckle Bock
127,6-4-3,Pale Ale - Belgian,26,5.0,"Not only a pitcher's best friend but also a great beer to share in a pinch with your best friends. A routine 6-4-3 provides a breath of fresh air, and like a double play, this provides that taste to get you out of any jam"
128,Airmail,Blonde Ale,12,5.0,We've all seen it before. A player is too relaxed or overzealous and sends an easy throw to the first baseman into the stands. Airmail is crisp and refreshing. It is easily enjoyed when relaxing or at play
129,"3 Up, 3 Down",IPA - Imperial / Double,85,8.6,"It’s the bottom of the ninth, and you need someone dependable to seal the victory. Like a reliable closer, you expect your Imperial IPA to be a strong option with an arsenal of different characteristics.
3 Up, 3 Down is a lights out choice that steps up to the challenge"
131,Czech Swing,Pilsner - Czech,33,5.4,"Here's a judgment call that everyone will agree on. The light, crisp flavor is as sharp as the batter at the plate. Perceptive beer-drinkers and batters alike always consider taking a Czech Swing"
133,Chin Music,Pale Ale - American,38,5.4,"You won’t want to back off from this one. The volume of citra hops in Chin Music is as reckless as a heater thrown high and inside, resulting in an explosive citrus flavor that will certainly send a message"
151,StoutBoiz,Stout - Imperial / Double Oatmeal,35,14.3,"The OG of our Pastry Stouts! ""Stoutboiz"", based off our award winning Oatmeal Stout and scaled up to 14%. Conditioned with a big blend of milk and dark chocolates, mounds of toasted organic coconut, and vanilla beans. It's designed to balance drinkability and a heck of a lot of flavor"
157,Laps Around the Sun,IPA - Triple New England / Hazy,105,10.0,"""LAPS AROUND THE SUN"" is a New England Style Triple IPA Whirpool ? Hopped with an Obnoxious Amount of Azacca, Simcoe, and El Dorado... We Dry Hopped this one 3X with a Brilliant Batch of 2020 Enigma, a Newer Hop from Australia"

This version was aged in Rye Whiskey barrels and blended with Tahitian and Madagasacar Vanilla beans at a rate of 1.5lb per BBL.

This beer was fermented and aged in oak and expresses a lively earthy acidity that’s jammy with a light natural tannic wine funk. ⠀
⠀
In the Fall of 2016, we set forth to brew our first Vermont spontaneous grown beer. We aptly chose Andrew Peterson's farm malthouse that is situated around Boyers Fruit orchard in Monkton. Under the cool night sky where the Vermont wild yeast blows we allowed this dextrin rich wort made from Vermont grown and malted barely, raw wheat from Nitty Gritty Grain of Charlotte, and a touch of aged hops from Homestead Hops of Starksboro settle in for the evening. We followed up with the same process in 2017 where both vintages sat untouched in 500 liter oak barrels. In the fall of 2018 we blended and finished this beer off with Elderberries from @Thorn Hill Farm of Greensboro. Following a final barrel fermentation and aging, we bottle conditioned this beer in the summer of 2019 with Burlington’s own BTV honey.

522,Haze,IPA - Imperial / Double,90,8.2,"Our Double IPA! We smell a ton of peach on the nose, with complimentary notes of orange and passionfruit. The flavor is similar with a blast of citrus fruit & peach quickly followed by a bounty of tropical fruit. A lingering and pleasant saturated hop oil finish awaits. . . . A real juice bomb of a beer"
523,Green,IPA - American,90,7.5,"Our cross-continental IPA! Made with Australian and American hops, this tropical heavy IPA opens up in the glass with notes of hugely flavorful notes of lemon-lime, pineapple, orange sorbet, and tangerine. It has a soft but pointed bitterness and a rich, velvety mouth feel. Intensely kettle and dry hopped yet balanced and flavorful, Green is a beloved crew favorite here at Tree House"
524,Alter Ego,IPA - American,72,6.8,"Alter Ego is a member of the Julius family, taking the base of Julius and adding a tremendous amount of Mosaic to the dry hop with a kiss of Amarillo. What results is a beer with all the deliciousness of Julius with a pungent additional layer of citrusy complexity. Over time, Alter Ego has become a truly singular member of the Tree House family"
525,Doppelgänger,IPA - Imperial / Double,88,8.2,This beer is an imperial version of Alter Ego. It is intensely kettle and dry hopped to produce a pungent and flavorful Double IPA that is super pleasant to drink. It is simply and easily described as a juicy and dank citrus bomb
527,Sap,IPA - American,80,7.3,"Though originally brewed as a ""Christmas"" beer, this piney IPA, brewed almost exclusively Chinook hops, was so enjoyable we decided to put it into the 'year round' rotation. With it's golden yellow color, rich aroma, and drying body, it's hard to stop drinking this one.

Sap is a deceptively soft beer brimming with distinctive notes of grapefruit, mango, pine, and earthy spice. With waves of diverse flavor, it is perhaps our most complex IPA. It is the result of our uncompromising dedication to fresh, progressive, delightful beer. We hope you enjoy it with laughter, good cheer and in the company of those you love"
528,Bright,IPA - Imperial / Double,75,7.8,"Bright was created to be a clean and elegant showcase for one of our favorite hops - Mosaic! It is crafted with a simple malt bill and fermented with clean American Ale yeast to create a flavor profile that is more a function of its vibrant fresh ingredients than an expression of yeast character. Bright’s aroma is a cornucopia of citrus dank… The taste follows suit with notes of grapefruit, sweet berries, and clementine with a gentle orange rind finish. She is dry, soft, and adequately bittered resulting in a very approachable yet pungent Double IPA"
529,JJJULIUSSS!,IPA - American,75,6.8,"Julius gone wild (not funky wild, like insane hop saturation wild)! For the second special edition of Julius brewed specifically for the third anniversary party, we pushed the level of citrus to the fringes of obscenity through additional kettle and dry hopping with the base Julius hop blend. The result is perhaps the most juicy and delectable creation we have ever made! Preposterous Julius, in the best way imaginable"
530,King Julius,IPA - Imperial / Double,85,8.2,"King Julius is an American Double IPA brewed to be an exceptionally flavorful, juicy, and hop saturated beer while never tiring the palate. Its vivid citrus aromas give way to flavors of orange creamsicle, mango smoothie, and a bounty of fresh tropical fruit. We find it to be supremely soft in the midst of an onslaught of flavor...a beer we are quite proud of"
533,Juice Machine,IPA - Imperial / Double,70,8.2,"Juice Machine was originally devised and brewed to support our very first trip to Extreme Beer Festival in 2014. It is essentially a marriage of the King Julius malt bill with a hopping schedule more intense than than Very Green. The use of Magnum, Columbus, Amarillo, Citra, and Galaxy creates perhaps our most complex beer with unapologetic flavors of mango, creamy orange sorbet, papaya, and passion fruit with wave after wave of juicy hop flavor. In spite of its intensity, it is pillowy soft and drinks like a true pleasure - the embodiment of the Tree House ideal of hoppy beer. Never abrasive or harsh, It is just as enjoyable on the last sip as it is on the first. It is a mess of hop flavor that takes us to a place that few other of our beers do. It’s hop nirvan"
535,Very Hazy,IPA - Imperial / Double,80,8.6,"A kicked up version of Haze, our Double IPA, Very Hazy is a beer that makes us Very Happy! Very Hazy conveys all the beautiful flavors of Haze, but with even greater depth and potency. Pungent grapefruit notes greet your palate while an underlying current of soft tropical fruit dances in the background. Just the right amount of bitterness balances the sweet fruit flavors while a velvety soft mouthfeel make you easily (and dangerously!) forget this one clocks in at 8.6% ABV. A huge and beautiful beer that maintains softness and delicacy"
545,That's What She Said,Stout - Milk / Sweet,28,5.6,"A sneakily complex beer, ""TWSS"" exhibits flavors of milk chocolate, dark roasted coffee, caramel, and even a hint of smoke. It is absolutely loaded with flavor for a 5.6% beer, and the inclusion of Lactose takes the edge off of the dry, roasty notes found in a typical stout. The adult chocolate milk shake. . . with this batch being very chocolate heavy! A beer that is notorious for converting ‘pale’ beer lovers to the dark side"
546,VIBRATIONS - DDH Nelson,IPA - New England / Hazy,70,6.5,"VIBRATIONS, my version on the New England IPA. This is a single IPA, not an oated to the max lactose bomb, just a simple, clean, bright, and soft IPA with tons of flavor. You can crush these. That’s what it was made for. Each VIBRATIONS will focus on a single hop"
547,WAVES - Vanilla,Stout - Imperial / Double,45,13.0,"Vanilla WAVES is the second edition to the WAVES series. Here we've taken our Waves base beer and added a significant amount Mexican and Ugandan Vanilla to it.

This isn’t your sticky sweet overly adjuncted stout. What you’re getting here is a throw back with a modern twist.

Aroma: Semi-sweet dark chocolate, soft-vanilla, hit of toffee, followed by strong coffee roast.
Taste: (Front Palate) Big dry semi-sweet chocolate followed by an oily vanilla spice that gives way to subtle caramel sweetness. (Mid Palate) You get a break here from the chocolate and get a pithy almost charcoal dryness, earthiness, and minerality. (Back Palate) Here the dark bitter bakers chocolate pops followed by a burst of coffee roast. As it settles you get a wave of bourbon and barrel burn that dissipates quickly but leaves a lingering semi-sweet chocolate oak stave.

The body is oily and viscous, really holding all the flavors together but allowing you to spend time with them individually.

This will not hit the pastry bois vanilla requirements. The Ugandan and Mexican Vanilla don’t give you that classic bakers vanilla. You get earthy and spicy flavors that one might not place as vanilla. Ugandan vanilla tends to impart big chocolate tones and that is most definitely the case here. The Mexican vanilla gives you a rye spice quality that buts up against some traditional vanilla but only slightly"
548,VIBRATIONS - DDH Citra,IPA - New England / Hazy,65,6.5,"VIBRATIONS, my version on the New England IPA. This is a single IPA, not an oated to the max lactose bomb, just a simple, clean, bright, and soft IPA with tons of flavor. You can crush these. That’s what it was made for. Each VIBRATIONS will focus on a single hop. In this version we explore Citra"
549,Dimensions of Time - 1,Stout - Imperial / Double,40,14.0,"Deep, rich chocolate flavor with smooth barrel character and low roast. This imperial stout has spent 15 months in a variety of barrels including 1792, WLW, OWA, Buffalo Trace, and Elijah Craig. Blend 1 is straight forward non-adjunct. This beer was brewed with Ellison Brewing + Spirits in East Lansing, MI as part of the BSP membership"
550,Dimensions of Time - Al Young Four Roses Barrel,Stout - Imperial / Double,50,14.0,"I had the privilege of acquiring a Four Roses single barrel, picked and signed for good measure by the legend Al Young himself. When brewing the base recipe of Dimensions of Time, I filled this barrel and let it sit for 27 months. 

The result is a decadent chocolate/bourbon molten cake. This is very much a traditional stout, which is specifically designed to showcase the barrel more than the leftover unfermented sugars (if you know what I mean). Don't expect pastry flavor or pudding viscosity. This stout is for the bourbon aficionados that enjoy a big-bodied stout with tons of naturally occurring chocolate, vanilla, caramel, leather, and bourbon"
551,WAVES - Maple,Stout - Russian Imperial,20,13.0,"With this iteration of WAVES, we tweaked the recipe a little to pull back on the roast and boost the sweetness. Our addition of real Maple Syrup inline on the way to the pasteurizer allowed it to homogenize and spread equally through the beer so each can has a nice balance. What you get with this iteration is a stout that leans a little more towards pastry without significantly overdoing it. As we experiment with the brewing system we’ll continue to tweak this recipe to perfection. Join us on the journey.

The aroma is chocolate, maple, and coffee along with the classic stout notes of grist, toffee, and muted vanilla. The first taste is grain sweetness followed by maple sweetness and when it hits the mid-palate you get waves of maple and coffee roast. Because of the addition of Maple you get a lingering sweetness on the back palate. This beer is chewy and thick. You could probably pour it on pancakes and be happy with the result. ?"
552,Double Barrel Legacy,Stout - Russian Imperial,43,14.0,"Thick, chewy, sweet Russian Imperial Stout aged in Rye Whiskey Barrels that were filled with Rum, then finished in Maple Syrup Bourbon Barrels. This beer has depth and complexity with notes of vanilla, chocolate, char, and bourbon"

Heady Topper was designed to showcase the complex flavors and aromas these flowers produce. The Alchemist has been brewing Heady Topper since 2003. This Double IPA is not intended to be the strongest or most bitter DIPA. It is brewed to give you wave after wave of hop flavor without any astringent bitterness. We brew Heady Topper with a proprietary blend of six hops – each imparting its own unique flavor and aroma. Take a big sip of Heady and see what hop flavors you can pick out. Orange? Tropical Fruit? Pink Grapefruit? Pine? Spice? There is just enough malt to give this beer some backbone, but not enough to take the hops away from the center stage"

Over 10 lbs./bbl of hops went into this gem of a DIPA. A ridiculous level of hop aroma, followed by a hop flavor that is literally juicy in texture. The bitterness is undefinable, just unreal.

920,OverRated,IPA - American,69,7.3,"It’s been said, “It’s easier to brew an extremely hoppy beer than an extremely balanced beer.” And you know us, we are always looking for the easy way out, so we jumped on the West Coast IPA Bandwagon and brewed this dry and hoppy ale. “Surly’s a little bit of a one-trick pony, they just brew gimmick beers,” and maybe we are OVERRATED, but at the end of the day, it’s just a beer.

940,Pilsner,Pilsner - Czech,38,4.9,"The story of pilsner starts in 19th century Bohemia when a Bavarian monk smuggled a special yeast to a brewmaster in Pilsen.
