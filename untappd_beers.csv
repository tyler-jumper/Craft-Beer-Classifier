The beer's appearance is a yellow straw-color, with a significant haze. Heavy citrus aromas of pineapple, orange flesh and mango dance on the nose and palate. The pilsner malt provides a medium body and wraps up each sip with a slight balancing bitterness"
1,Galaxy Dry Hopped Fort Point,Pale Ale - American,45,6.6,"This version of our signature American pale ale is dry hopped with the pungent Galaxy variety.

4,Haze,IPA - Imperial / Double,90,8.2,"Our Double IPA! We smell a ton of peach on the nose, with complimentary notes of orange and passionfruit. The flavor is similar with a blast of citrus fruit & peach quickly followed by a bounty of tropical fruit. A lingering and pleasant saturated hop oil finish awaits. . . . A real juice bomb of a beer"
5,Green,IPA - American,90,7.5,"Our cross-continental IPA! Made with Australian and American hops, this tropical heavy IPA opens up in the glass with notes of hugely flavorful notes of lemon-lime, pineapple, orange sorbet, and tangerine. It has a soft but pointed bitterness and a rich, velvety mouth feel. Intensely kettle and dry hopped yet balanced and flavorful, Green is a beloved crew favorite here at Tree House"
6,Alter Ego,IPA - American,72,6.8,"Alter Ego is a member of the Julius family, taking the base of Julius and adding a tremendous amount of Mosaic to the dry hop with a kiss of Amarillo. What results is a beer with all the deliciousness of Julius with a pungent additional layer of citrusy complexity. Over time, Alter Ego has become a truly singular member of the Tree House family"
7,DoppelgÃ¤nger,IPA - Imperial / Double,88,8.2,This beer is an imperial version of Alter Ego. It is intensely kettle and dry hopped to produce a pungent and flavorful Double IPA that is super pleasant to drink. It is simply and easily described as a juicy and dank citrus bomb
8,Sap,IPA - American,80,7.3,"Though originally brewed as a ""Christmas"" beer, this piney IPA, brewed almost exclusively Chinook hops, was so enjoyable we decided to put it into the 'year round' rotation. With it's golden yellow color, rich aroma, and drying body, it's hard to stop drinking this one.

Sap is a deceptively soft beer brimming with distinctive notes of grapefruit, mango, pine, and earthy spice. With waves of diverse flavor, it is perhaps our most complex IPA. It is the result of our uncompromising dedication to fresh, progressive, delightful beer. We hope you enjoy it with laughter, good cheer and in the company of those you love"
9,Bright,IPA - Imperial / Double,75,7.8,"Bright was created to be a clean and elegant showcase for one of our favorite hops - Mosaic! It is crafted with a simple malt bill and fermented with clean American Ale yeast to create a flavor profile that is more a function of its vibrant fresh ingredients than an expression of yeast character. Brightâs aroma is a cornucopia of citrus dankâ¦ The taste follows suit with notes of grapefruit, sweet berries, and clementine with a gentle orange rind finish. She is dry, soft, and adequately bittered resulting in a very approachable yet pungent Double IPA"
10,JJJULIUSSS!,IPA - American,75,6.8,"Julius gone wild (not funky wild, like insane hop saturation wild)! For the second special edition of Julius brewed specifically for the third anniversary party, we pushed the level of citrus to the fringes of obscenity through additional kettle and dry hopping with the base Julius hop blend. The result is perhaps the most juicy and delectable creation we have ever made! Preposterous Julius, in the best way imaginable"
11,King Julius,IPA - Imperial / Double,85,8.2,"King Julius is an American Double IPA brewed to be an exceptionally flavorful, juicy, and hop saturated beer while never tiring the palate. Its vivid citrus aromas give way to flavors of orange creamsicle, mango smoothie, and a bounty of fresh tropical fruit. We find it to be supremely soft in the midst of an onslaught of flavor...a beer we are quite proud of"
12,Juice Machine,IPA - Imperial / Double,70,8.2,"Juice Machine was originally devised and brewed to support our very first trip to Extreme Beer Festival in 2014. It is essentially a marriage of the King Julius malt bill with a hopping schedule more intense than than Very Green. The use of Magnum, Columbus, Amarillo, Citra, and Galaxy creates perhaps our most complex beer with unapologetic flavors of mango, creamy orange sorbet, papaya, and passion fruit with wave after wave of juicy hop flavor. In spite of its intensity, it is pillowy soft and drinks like a true pleasure - the embodiment of the Tree House ideal of hoppy beer. Never abrasive or harsh, It is just as enjoyable on the last sip as it is on the first. It is a mess of hop flavor that takes us to a place that few other of our beers do. Itâs hop nirvan"
13,Very Hazy,IPA - Imperial / Double,80,8.6,"A kicked up version of Haze, our Double IPA, Very Hazy is a beer that makes us Very Happy! Very Hazy conveys all the beautiful flavors of Haze, but with even greater depth and potency. Pungent grapefruit notes greet your palate while an underlying current of soft tropical fruit dances in the background. Just the right amount of bitterness balances the sweet fruit flavors while a velvety soft mouthfeel make you easily (and dangerously!) forget this one clocks in at 8.6% ABV. A huge and beautiful beer that maintains softness and delicacy"
14,That's What She Said,Stout - Milk / Sweet,28,5.6,"A sneakily complex beer, ""TWSS"" exhibits flavors of milk chocolate, dark roasted coffee, caramel, and even a hint of smoke. It is absolutely loaded with flavor for a 5.6% beer, and the inclusion of Lactose takes the edge off of the dry, roasty notes found in a typical stout. The adult chocolate milk shake. . . with this batch being very chocolate heavy! A beer that is notorious for converting âpaleâ beer lovers to the dark side"
15,Gertrude's Ghost,IPA - New England / Hazy,24,7.0,Juicy fruit and citrus are dominant in aroma and flavor with low bitterness for dangerously drinkable beer.

18,Loaded For Bear,IPA - Imperial / Double,81,9.0,"Loaded for Bear - An Imperial IPA with big hop flavor and a pronounced bitterness.

20,Hawk Watch,IPA - American,56,7.0,"Big hops is the name of the game for this IPA, but don`t let the hoppy characteristics shy you away from this delicious IPA. Thanks to the addition of Amarillo, this hoppy IPA is a citrus bomb. We paired the Amarillo hops with a new variety of hops straight from Germany, Callista. Calllista hops attribute to the juicy flavor in this IPA. 7% ABV and 56 IB"
21,Well Made IPA,IPA - American,56,7.0,"The classic American IPA is âwell-made.â The big hop flavor and floral aroma of ygis brew comes from the generous use of Cascade and Amarillo hops. Easy drinking with a crisp, clean finish that will have you coming back for more"
22,Pumpkin Patches,Pumpkin / Yam Beer,20,5.5,"This is a very approachable pumpkin beer, it is well balanced with just the right amount of homemade pumpkin spice. We received our pumpkins from Great Country Farm in Bluemont, VA and then we roasted the pumpkins with brown sugar"
23,Steep Slopes,IPA - American,40,7.0,"The slight reddish hue comes from the use of Red X, a relatively new malt from Germany. The us of Simcoe hops smooths out the pronounced piney character from the generous dose of Centennial hops. This brew has big hop characteristics without an overwhelming bitterness"
24,2 Hopper,IPA - American,67,6.4,"What looks like an easy play turns into trouble when the ball makes a few extra hops than the fielder intended. The 2 Hopper has just enough hops for an IPA, but still has an easy finish to make the out"
25,Knuckle Bock,Bock - Single / Traditional,20,6.5,We bet you didnât see this one coming. This is a one-of-a-kind bock thatâs packed full of rich flavors yet is surprisingly smooth. Baffle your friends when you hand them a Knuckle Bock
26,6-4-3,Pale Ale - Belgian,26,5.0,"Not only a pitcher's best friend but also a great beer to share in a pinch with your best friends. A routine 6-4-3 provides a breath of fresh air, and like a double play, this provides that taste to get you out of any jam"
27,Airmail,Blonde Ale,12,5.0,We've all seen it before. A player is too relaxed or overzealous and sends an easy throw to the first baseman into the stands. Airmail is crisp and refreshing. It is easily enjoyed when relaxing or at play
28,"3 Up, 3 Down",IPA - Imperial / Double,85,8.6,"Itâs the bottom of the ninth, and you need someone dependable to seal the victory. Like a reliable closer, you expect your Imperial IPA to be a strong option with an arsenal of different characteristics.
3 Up, 3 Down is a lights out choice that steps up to the challenge"
29,Czech Swing,Pilsner - Czech,33,5.4,"Here's a judgment call that everyone will agree on. The light, crisp flavor is as sharp as the batter at the plate. Perceptive beer-drinkers and batters alike always consider taking a Czech Swing"
30,Chin Music,Pale Ale - American,38,5.4,"You wonât want to back off from this one. The volume of citra hops in Chin Music is as reckless as a heater thrown high and inside, resulting in an explosive citrus flavor that will certainly send a message"

This beer was fermented and aged in oak and expresses a lively earthy acidity thatâs jammy with a light natural tannic wine funk. â 
â 
In the Fall of 2016, we set forth to brew our first Vermont spontaneous grown beer. We aptly chose Andrew Peterson's farm malthouse that is situated around Boyers Fruit orchard in Monkton. Under the cool night sky where the Vermont wild yeast blows we allowed this dextrin rich wort made from Vermont grown and malted barely, raw wheat from Nitty Gritty Grain of Charlotte, and a touch of aged hops from Homestead Hops of Starksboro settle in for the evening. We followed up with the same process in 2017 where both vintages sat untouched in 500 liter oak barrels. In the fall of 2018 we blended and finished this beer off with Elderberries from @Thorn Hill Farm of Greensboro. Following a final barrel fermentation and aging, we bottle conditioned this beer in the summer of 2019 with Burlingtonâs own BTV honey.

109,WAVES - Vanilla,Stout - Imperial / Double,45,13.0,"Vanilla WAVES is the second edition to the WAVES series. Here we've taken our Waves base beer and added a significant amount Mexican and Ugandan Vanilla to it.

This isnât your sticky sweet overly adjuncted stout. What youâre getting here is a throw back with a modern twist.

Aroma: Semi-sweet dark chocolate, soft-vanilla, hit of toffee, followed by strong coffee roast.
Taste: (Front Palate) Big dry semi-sweet chocolate followed by an oily vanilla spice that gives way to subtle caramel sweetness. (Mid Palate) You get a break here from the chocolate and get a pithy almost charcoal dryness, earthiness, and minerality. (Back Palate) Here the dark bitter bakers chocolate pops followed by a burst of coffee roast. As it settles you get a wave of bourbon and barrel burn that dissipates quickly but leaves a lingering semi-sweet chocolate oak stave.

The body is oily and viscous, really holding all the flavors together but allowing you to spend time with them individually.

This will not hit the pastry bois vanilla requirements. The Ugandan and Mexican Vanilla donât give you that classic bakers vanilla. You get earthy and spicy flavors that one might not place as vanilla. Ugandan vanilla tends to impart big chocolate tones and that is most definitely the case here. The Mexican vanilla gives you a rye spice quality that buts up against some traditional vanilla but only slightly"
110,VIBRATIONS - DDH Citra,IPA - New England / Hazy,65,6.5,"VIBRATIONS, my version on the New England IPA.

111,Dimensions of Time - 1,Stout - Imperial / Double,40,14.0,"Deep, rich chocolate flavor with smooth barrel character and low roast.

This beer was brewed with Ellison Brewing + Spirits in East Lansing, MI as part of the BSP membership"
112,Dimensions of Time - Al Young Four Roses Barrel,Stout - Imperial / Double,50,14.0,"I had the privilege of acquiring a Four Roses single barrel, picked and signed for good measure by the legend Al Young himself. When brewing the base recipe of Dimensions of Time, I filled this barrel and let it sit for 27 months. 

The result is a decadent chocolate/bourbon molten cake. This is very much a traditional stout, which is specifically designed to showcase the barrel more than the leftover unfermented sugars (if you know what I mean). Don't expect pastry flavor or pudding viscosity. This stout is for the bourbon aficionados that enjoy a big-bodied stout with tons of naturally occurring chocolate, vanilla, caramel, leather, and bourbon"
113,WAVES - Maple,Stout - Russian Imperial,20,13.0,"With this iteration of WAVES, we tweaked the recipe a little to pull back on the roast and boost the sweetness. Our addition of real Maple Syrup inline on the way to the pasteurizer allowed it to homogenize and spread equally through the beer so each can has a nice balance. What you get with this iteration is a stout that leans a little more towards pastry without significantly overdoing it. As we experiment with the brewing system weâll continue to tweak this recipe to perfection. Join us on the journey.

The aroma is chocolate, maple, and coffee along with the classic stout notes of grist, toffee, and muted vanilla. The first taste is grain sweetness followed by maple sweetness and when it hits the mid-palate you get waves of maple and coffee roast. Because of the addition of Maple you get a lingering sweetness on the back palate. This beer is chewy and thick. You could probably pour it on pancakes and be happy with the result. ?"

321,Full Nelson,IPA - Imperial / Double,100,8.7,"To call Nelson Sauvin an aggressive hop would be a vast understatement. What would happen if you made a DIPA that featured this hop??? Over 10 lbs./bbl of hops went into this gem of a DIPA. A ridiculous level of hop aroma, followed by a hop flavor that is literally juicy in texture. The bitterness is undefinable, just unreal. If our Elevated IPA is on the hoppy side of the aisle for you, stay away. If you drink that beer and think to yourself in Homer Simpsonâs voice, âThatâs kinda hoppyâ¦ I guessâ¦â prepare to meet your match. This beer is gonna put the beat down. Will you tap out before you finish the pint"

326,Father Nelson,IPA - Imperial / Double,100,10.6,"Irresponsible, offensive, repugnant, blasphemous and downright creepy. This is Father Nelson. Father Nelson is a very bad beer. Reaching to the outer expanses of what is possible with hops and alcohol we have created a beer that is literally dripping in hop oils. Donât be surprised if you see a slick floating in your glass, and not to worry, just hops. Nelson Sauvin gets the starring role in yet another, ridiculously delicious hopgasm from your friends at La Cumbre Brewing Co"

Early in the morning of Saturday, August 26th, several farmhands stayed up and harvested Chinook for us in Southern Colorado which would then be driven down for the sole purpose of making this very special batch of the IPA that put Albuquerque on the proverbial craft beer map.

518,TartanÂ® Ale,Scottish Ale,24,5.0,"Scottish beers in the 1800âs were taxed on their strength, with the strong and better quality beers costing more. Customers developed the habit of asking for them by the tax ratings, or shilling names. The 80-shilling style was one of the stronger types that could be purchased, containing 4.0-5.5% alcohol.

The 80-shilling beers are traditionally malty, without much hop character, as hops did not grow in Scotland and were expensive to import. Our Tartan Ale is crafted by Head Brewer Jonathan Reeves.

We steep War Shoreâs Chesapeake Bay oyster shells in the brewing water to add mineral content and then add the oysters and their liquor to the brew during the boil. The oysters add a subtle whiff of a sea breeze, a slight briny character and a smooth textural element to the beer.

Revival Stout is available on draft only, in Port Cityâs Tasting Room, and on tap at select oyster houses, restaurants and bars in DC, Maryland and Virginia. Additionally, five percent of the sales of Revival Stout will be donated to the Oyster Recovery Partnership to support their efforts to revive the oyster population in the Chesapeake Bay and its tributaries"
522,Franconian Kellerbier,Kellerbier / Zwickelbier,35,5.0,"Franconian Kellerbier is a hop forward German-style lager.

529,Bishop's Barrel No. 17,Adambier,30,13.2,"Adambier Aged in Bourbon Barrels

Bishop’s Barrel No. 17 pours a mahogany color with ruby highlights. It is a slightly hazy beer with pronounced toffee and honey aromas, and chocolate when it's cold. The smoke from the base beer is subtle, and as it warms up, it becomes more in balance with the rest of the flavors. The wood character blends well with the smoked malt.

The whiskey plays the supporting role in this beer. At first sip, the honey and chocolate are well balanced, with the whiskey finishing it off. This is indeed a dessert beer. The smoke provides just enough to balance the sweetness. Perfectly paired with a bar of chocolate smothered in toffee and honey, next to the fire while wearing your finest velvet smoking jacket.

The current club continues to be recognized as one of the premier homebrewing clubs in the US and produces outstanding quality beer.
Adambier is a rare style that tastes like a cross between an English Barley wine and a doppelbock. What should you look for in an Adambier? Malt, malt, and more malt. Just as a big Belgians will showcase esters and yeast complexity, and a double IPA displays the hops, an Adambier defines complex maltiness. The malt is caramelized and roasty, but those flavors come with a long boil and fermentation, not with the use of roast or caramel malts. The recipe for this collaboration is based on the club’s Vice President, John Aitchison’s infamous homebrew version. Read Less"

Altbiers are fermented with a unique yeast that blurs the line between ale and lager, striking a delicate balance with assertive malt and hop flavors. Traditionally a neighborhood specialty, old-time Alt breweries would often add their own twist on the style to distinguish it from local competition. We pay homage to that tradition with our variation which we brewed with three different types of biscuit malt and aged in bourbon barrels for six months.

The high alcohol shows itself visually with legs that stick to the glass when swirled. The aroma brings forth a bouquet of bourbon, vanilla and Belgian yeast characteristics. As it warms, a liquid dessert is brought forth with aromas similar to flan and bananas foster.

The flavor is sweet throughout without being cloying - a palate of sweet, sticky toffee with a nice dark fruit/cherry parfait accompaniment.

683,Divine Reserve No. 13,Belgian Quadrupel,26,11.0,"For this Quad, the goal was to go as big as possible while still being as drinkable as any other beer you might pull off the shelf.

The aroma is distinctly Belgian and has a hint of fruit. As with most Belgian beers, the hops are primarily used for bitterness and provide little to no flavor or aroma. We kept the malt bill relatively simple to allow each malt to come through in its own way without getting all muddled together. The caramel and chocolate malts, in particular, work well together and you can taste each of them in the beer. We also added a large amount of Belgian Extra Dark Candi Syrup during fermentation, which darkened the color, imparted dark fruit-like flavors, and boosted the alcohol. Despite its high strength though, the alcohol only comes out as a warmth on the back end but is not over powering. The aftertaste is slightly sweet but also has a dryness that makes you want more.

This beer is best enjoyed at 50°F to 55°F. Read Less"

Rich flavors and aromas of fresh bread, dark fruits, honey and brown sugar are up front with the Belgian yeast strain contributing a punch of spice and fruity esters wafting up with every sip.

German Magnum and Cascade hops impart an earthy, spicy hop character. Hops are definitely not the star of the show here - just enough bitterness and flavor to ensure balance in the finished product. Dextrose and dark Belgian candi sugar boost the sugar concentration and impart a dried fruit character to this huge ale. Chamomile flowers to add to the complex aromas we have already imparted.

687,Fitzcarraldo Barrel Aged Reserve (2016),Belgian Strong Dark Ale,25,11.2,"In time for Zwickelmania 2016, we are excited to release a special ‘cuvee,’ a special blend of beers created by our brewers. The finished blend is a beer we’ve named Fitzcarraldo. The majority of the blend is a Belgian dark strong ale that spent over 18 months in Bourbon barrels. The extended aging allowed for soft and complex oxidative flavors to come out– there are notes of fig, date, and port. As the beer mellowed, the classic Belgian yeast profile did as well: it shows light notes of clove and red currant. This was blended with a small portion of a Bourbon barrel-aged stout that had spent 12 months in barrels. This beer added some sweetness and richness of body to the blend. Finally, to brighten and enliven the beer, the brewers chose to add a dash of Toro Red, our smoky amber ale. The young beer gives the blend a vibrancy that is uncommon and welcome in a blend of older beers. Read Less"

The beer pours a bright golden color. The nose is a mixture of phenolics from the Belgian wit yeast and light citrus from the American hops with a touch of graininess. Rye adds sweetness and complexity to the pilsner and aromatic malts. The spice of the rye is somewhat subdued at lower temperatures but becomes more apparent as the beer warms. Cascade and centennial hops were used for both flavor and aroma, adding floral and citrus notes to play off the strengths of the yeast. Belgian candi sugar was added during fermentation to bump up the alcohol while allowing the beer to avoid finishing too sweet. The dry finish hides the 10% alcohol nicely and makes you want to take another sip. This beer is best enjoyed at 50°F to 55°F. Read Less"

Our Class of ‘88 beer is brewed with whole flower Mt Hood hops, which were first introduced in 1988, then transferred to Muscat casks and aged with Michigan Riesling Grape juice and Oregon Pinot Noir grape must. The result is a golden belgian strong ale with a pleasant aroma of semi-sweet Riesling grapes and fresh green hops, complemented by a touch of tartness that is quickly cut by a bright, dry finish reminiscent of a refreshing white wine.

This 100 Barrel Series beer is proof of that! After being unable to settle on one particular style, Mark and Jim thought it would be fun to try blending two of their favorite styles – pale ale and stout. Friendship is like brewing… always a creative collaboration.

This complex, yet drinkable beer is a blend of pale ale and stout. The aroma is a combination of hop from the pale ale with roasted notes and just a hint of smoke from the stout. The rounded body of the beer starts with sweetness from the caramel malt in the pale ale and finishes with aggressive roasted fullness of the stout. The finish is crisp and bitter, but with no astringency. This perfectly blended beer is the marriage of two excellent individual beers coming together to make one phenomenal brew. Read Less"

The Padauk provides notes of waffle cone and chocolate to the beer, while the Amburana layers in accents of cinnamon spice and vanilla. The base imperial brown ale was aged for nearly 12 months in high rye bourbon barrels acquired from Four Roses.

Lucky for us his famous Steam-beer recipe didn't burn up with it! On a history binge at the city archives one afternoon, we stumbled upon this historic recipe and set out to brew it once again.

1096,Chicha,Corn Beer / Chicha de Jora,4,3.1,"Spit happens - and when it does, you brew Chicha. An ancient Peruvian beer brewed with corn that’s chewed up and spit out, Chicha is one of our most talked about brewing creations.

So what exactly is Chicha? In Peru, small communities produce it from masticated maize, naturally fermented in large clay pots and often flavored with indigenous fruit and spices. Here at Dogfish Head, we reproduced the ancient beer by creating Chicha from co- worker masticated purple Peruvian corn, malted corn and malted barley. The wort is then boiled for full sterilization, chilled and blended with strawberries. Fermented with a unique blend of yeast strains, Chicha clocks in at 3.1% ABV with fruity, spicy aromas and a dry finish.

We've been brewing this ancient beverage since 2009 and this year, we enlisted the help of 100+ co-workers to prepare the beer's main ingredient - masticated purple maize ... and for the first time, we released 200 (750ml) bottles of this one-of-a-kind brew exclusively at our Milton Tasting Room & Kitchen on Saturday, March 10, 2018.

We chose these two particular grape varietals due to the contrasting nature of the fruit. According to our Head Brewer Averie Swanson, “We wanted to create a blend that exhibited the darker fruit and pepper notes of the Syrah with the brighter cherry and more perfumey character of the Sangiovese.

The 2016 edition of Transatlantique Kriek began life in the oaken vessels of Gert Christiaens’ Oud Beersel, a 130-year-old Belgian lambic brewery. After time spent aging in wood, Oud Beersel’s lambic was blended with tart cherries and shipped across the Atlantic to New Belgium.
Clear, ruby red stained glass, fluffy pink cotton candy foam.
Cherry pie filling and pastry, almonds and vanilla, berry jam, raspberries, hibiscus, green apple.
Fruity sweetness, quickly joined by light bright tartness.
Sprizty, mouthwatering, SweetTart candy chalky.
The lager and sour beer is then mixed with the cherry lambic at a ratio of 50% kriek, 25% sour Felix, and 25% golden lager. Morello Cherries: Too sour for some people's tastes to be eaten fresh. The beer’s malty sugars balance the acidity and brings out the fruit's aroma and flavor.

We decided on the style that we did because we used 2-row, 6-row, and both brown and black rice as our base malts. This lends itself to the clean, crisp, and refreshing character associated with a traditional malt liquor. We then used some midnight wheat and black barley to obtain the dark color and slight roast character in the taste.

This year we teamed up with Bierstadt Lager of Denver Colorado to brew this classic German-style Pilsner using all American ingredients including Crystal hops from the Hop Head Farms in Michigan & California grown, floor malted grain from Admiral Maltings of Alameda, CA & releasing it on the 504th anniversary of the Reinheitsgebot, April 23, 2020, bringing glory back to the American made lager.

2262,Good Gourd Have Mercy,Pumpkin / Yam Beer,23,12.2,"Since man began pondering the great mysteries of the universe, one question has persisted: is the pumpkin, the most obtuse of the gourds, inherently good in nature? The philosophers at Cigar City Brewing have attempted to answer this eternal query by marrying the gourd with the complimentary flavors of Ceylon cinnamon, Jamaican allspice, Zanzibar cloves and nutmeg. The answer presents itself in the bottle of high-gravity complexity you now hold in your hand, and the answer is good. This Imperial Pumpkin Ale was aged in two different types of barrels; half was aged in rum barrels and half was aged in bourbon barrels.

This beer has been retired.

We utilized Pale Malt as the base and an assortment of unique caramelized grains from Germany and Chile along with Malted Carolina Rye from a small artisan producer in North Carolina called Riverbend Malt House. In the brew kettle we hit it with Apollo, Citra, Crystal and Chinook hops for bittering, flavor and there amazingly bright citrus aromas.

In an attempt to bring the hop aroma up to another level we dry-hopped this beer in the fermentation tank with Crystal, Chinook and Cascade, very traditional old-school aroma hops.

The resulting ale has a beautiful red hue with layers of caramel malt character and an undertone of spicy, earthy grain flavor from the malted rye with a clean crisp bitterness and huge punch of floral and citrus aromas and a hint of fresh pine! Read Less"

But when we procured some seasoned barrels from our friends at Templeton Rye, we asked ourselves, “Why not?” Why not brew a rich, tawny rye ale, then mellow it in the warmth of charred oak rye whiskey casks?

The flavors and aromas of the base beer are true to the Divine Reserve No. 4. It is filled with caramel, toffee, dried figs, cocoa and a slight peatiness. Where it deviates is with the roundness of flavors the bourbon barrel contributes. Vanilla, cinnamon and touch of rich earthy pipe tobacco mix with an alcohol warmth that adds to the rich creaminess. The great thing about this beer is that the barrel aging adds to the whole without taking away the character of the original.

The warmer this beer gets the better it tastes. We recommend enjoying between 55°F and 60°F. Read Less"

A traditional Scottish ale fit the bill nicely, featuring rich malt and a subtle smokiness, but not too cloying or heavy for a summer release. Aged for months in both 26-year-old Speyside, single malt Scotch whisky barrels and American oak bourbon barrels, it features an array of flavors while never allowing one note to overpower another. The peat smoke intermingles nicely with the vanilla notes from the bourbon, while toffee, honey, and candied fruit round out the beer. The resulting blend is a delicious dram that we think you’ll enjoy sharing with others. Read Less"

We’re doing our best to keep the tradition alive by brewing and aging this beer here on the west coast.

Additionally, there is a fullness of body and a slight residual coating effect in the finish that belies the very slight level of residual sugar remaining after the fermentation of this beer. This full body is from the variety of grains we used which lend texture/viscosity. Read Less"

It is rare for Bourbon to age in barrels for more than twenty-three years. But these barrels patiently sat for over thirty years. The extra years developed a distinct and complex character that makes them truly one-of-a kind. We filled those barrels with Bourbon County Brand Stout, and then stored them away in our Chicago Barrel House to age for two more years. With these rare barrels from our friends at Heaven Hill we believe this is one of the finest beers we have ever produced. This is Goose Island Rare Bourbon County Brand Stout for 2015. Read Less"

The flavor starts as a blast of milk chocolate, sweet maple syrup, and rich fresh coffee as deeper complexities are uncovered as it warms. The crew here at Tree House tastes “chocolate covered maple candy”, “vanilla”, “chocolate cake”, “brown sugar”, and “fresh roasted coffee”.

2798,Scatter Signal (2020),Stout - Imperial / Double Pastry,40,14.8,"Let your plans be dark and impenetrable as night...

Scatter Signal is an ode to progress, however hampered. To unseen development that is quiet and steady. To unshakable perseverance, even as the ground trembles.

Scatter Signal was forged from the liquid that made Bottle Logic what it is -- our World Beer Cup-clad Darkstar November, here now built and brawned to withstand war. Coffee for vigor, chocolate to fortify, marshmallows for resilience.

This 14.8% ABV Imperial Mocha-Marshmallow Stout is a blend of liquid aged from 12 to 24 months in a medley of our favorite bourbon barrels. It was conditioned on the 'Southern Weather' and 'Monarch' blends of coffee beans roasted by our brothers in arms at Onyx Coffee Lab for a complex foundation of chocolate brownie and burnt sugar undertones.

Cacao nibs bolster the chocolate front -- Ecuadorian nibs were chosen specifically for the nutty, hot-chocolate-like flavors they impart. Marshmallows were our finishing touch; added in abundance for their softly sweet aroma, for a bounce of viscosity, and amidst a very hard year, for the outright joy of it. In the absence of joy, there is nothing worth fighting for.

Double DBA brings its signature vanilla-infused crème brulée flavor and Helldorado brings balance with honey notes and light leather nuances. A dash of Wookey Jack offers fresh hop notes creating even more complexity. XVII is full of soft chocolate and warm spice perfectly balanced by toasted coconut, bourbon barrel notes and smooth creamy malt mellowness.

Stickee Monkee lends rich maple syrup, spicy cinnamon, and ripe fig flavors while Bravo adds barrel character and bourbon notes.

2931,Firestone 21 (XXI) Anniversary Ale,Strong Ale - American,28,11.8,"This year’s Anniversary beer is a magical blend of five components. Chocolatey, mild Velvet Merkin takes the lead setting the stage full of lush malt and barrel driven texture, yet tempered alcohol strength. The rest of the components fall perfectly in line, backing Velvet Merkin up with luscious caramel complexity and a creamy malt symphony. The final component adds a new twist – the rum barrel-soaked and lean Helldorado makes its Anniversary debut, bringing a fresh splash of island-spice to a ridiculously balanced barrel-aged brew. This is one of those times that the whole truly equals more than the sum of its parts. I couldn’t be happier with the result.

This beer is unfiltered and unfined, so there will be a small amount of sediment in the bottom of the bottle. XXI is best enjoyed poured carefully into a half-filled brandy snifter or wine glass. Allow it to warm to 55F to fully enjoy the pleasing and complex aromas. As the beer sits and breathes in the glass the true complexity of this blend is revealed, so take your time. If you wait to open your bottle later, store it in a cool dark place. Like our other Anniversary offerings, this beer will age well and change favorably for years to come. It was an absolute pleasure in the making and I truly hope you enjoy our 12th oak-aged blend! The journey continues.

This beer is dedicated to all of the new mothers and fathers within the FW Family and to their little ones who are our future.

English hop varieties contribute subtle herbal, peppery qualities. The beer was brewed in batches; some was fermented on oak, some was fermented normally, and some was allowed to sour in the mash tun before being transferred to a fermenter. Batches were then blended until desired levels of wood and tartness were achieved for the final product.
