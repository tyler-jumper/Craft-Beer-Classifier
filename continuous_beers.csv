4,Bishop's Barrel No. 17,Saint Arnold Brewing Company,30,13.2,"Adambier Aged in Bourbon Barrels

Bishop’s Barrel No. 17 pours a mahogany color with ruby highlights. It is a slightly hazy beer with pronounced toffee and honey aromas, and chocolate when it's cold. The smoke from the base beer is subtle, and as it warms up, it becomes more in balance with the rest of the flavors. The wood character blends well with the smoked malt.

The whiskey plays the supporting role in this beer. At first sip, the honey and chocolate are well balanced, with the whiskey finishing it off. This is indeed a dessert beer. The smoke provides just enough to balance the sweetness. Perfectly paired with a bar of chocolate smothered in toffee and honey, next to the fire while wearing your finest velvet smoking jacket.

5,Adam,Hair of the Dog Brewing Company,50,10.0,"Adam is a recreation of a historic beerstyle. Originally made in Dortmunder, Germany, it was the first beer I produced when I opened Hair of the Dog. Rich in flavor, Adam is best served as a dessert beer. It is great with chocolate or cigars, or just a warm fire and good company"
8,Dortmunder Adambier,Blue Pants Brewery,50,12.7,"A recreation of a historical German style, the Dortmunder Adambier became extinct after the implementation of the Reinheitsgebot. Brewed with a substantial amount of dark, smoked malts, traditional German hops, and fermented with Brettanomyces, the Adambier was aged in oak barrels for one year. Read Less"
10,Arcanum (Singularis #1) (Hillrock Estate Solera Whiskey Barrel),OEC Brewing (Ordinem Ecentrici Coctores),46,11.0,"Arcanum is our Adambier. Adambier is an extinct German ale style that was brewed around Dortmund. It was reminiscent of a strong altbier brewed to about 11% abv & was fairly well hopped for its time. It was then matured & soured in oak barrels.

This Singularis version was matured in small 100L Hillrock Estate Solera Whiskey barrels for 7 months. This beer is still but may develop a hint of carbonation over time"
11,Thurston Adambier,New Helvetia Brewing Company,18,12.0,"Germany has always brewed; and before their lagers forever changed the way the world looked at beer, the German city of Dortmund was known for a strong, dark ale known as Adambier, the progenitor beer. Brewed with copious amounts of dark malt and fermented at low temperatures for months, or even years. Adambier is a style that has been unjustly forgotten, and it has been a pleasure to reconstruct this historical beer. Ours is a deep, tawny color that’s boozy, with hints of vanilla. Gentle whisps of ripe plums and caramel meld with the deep undertones of chocolate and tobacco, with lush aromas of sherry and honey"
16,Wild Sour Series: Adambier,DESTIHL Brewery,40,9.0,"Adambier is a very complex, dark and historically obscure German-style sour ale. The initial impression of rich, dark chocolate malt with touches of fig-like and raisin-like flavors gives way to the caramel-toasty and lightly smoky malt character with low hop presence and bitterness, all sharply cut by a wild lactic sour finish and topped off with tannins from wood aging"
17,Deacon's Nightcap,Figueroa Mountain Brewing Co.,33,10.5,"Deacon’s Nightcap is a collaboration between Figueroa Mountain and the Maltose Falcons homebrew club. Founded in 1974, the Maltose Falcons are the oldest homebrew club in California. The club was active in the 1978 in efforts to legalize homebrewing in the state of California. The current club continues to be recognized as one of the premier homebrewing clubs in the US and produces outstanding quality beer.
Adambier is a rare style that tastes like a cross between an English Barley wine and a doppelbock. What should you look for in an Adambier? Malt, malt, and more malt. Just as a big Belgians will showcase esters and yeast complexity, and a double IPA displays the hops, an Adambier defines complex maltiness. The malt is caramelized and roasty, but those flavors come with a long boil and fermentation, not with the use of roast or caramel malts. The recipe for this collaboration is based on the club’s Vice President, John Aitchison’s infamous homebrew version. Read Less"
24,Who The F%&# Is Adam,Inbound BrewCo,10,9.1,"What the F%&# is an Adambier? This dark, fruity, funky concoction was brewed as a dark dortmunder, kettle soured with lactobacillus brevis, and fermented in oak barrels with ten strains of brettanomyces yeasts. We still have no idea who the F%&# Adam is, though"
26,Du Hast Mich Gefrogt! German-style Sour Dark Adambier,Hoppin' Frog Brewery,60,8.2,"Fermented with ale yeast, lager yeast, and other things, a wild mix of uber-good flavors is created in this ancient German-style sour Dark Adambier from centuries ago. Working in collaboration with our friend, historian, and brewmaster Sebastian Sauer from Freigeist Brewery in Cologne, Germany we made this old-style beer style with a wide array of German malts for a rich, authentic taste. Prost - Cheers!"

A nod to the German tradition of the ""Sticke"" or ""Secret"" recipe Altair, this Sticke Alt has been aged in American Oak Whiskey barrels for 5 months. The result is a full-bodied Altbier with oak and vanilla notes to blend in harmony with the old world German malts and hops. Serve at 50°F"
30,Barrel Roll No. 7 - Tailslide (2013),Hangar 24 Craft Brewing,44,10.5,"It’s with heightened awareness that one attempts a maneuver as daring as the Tailslide, and with equal poise that we bring you this bourbon barrel-aged version of our popular 4th Anniversary Ale. Originally crafted as a doubled version of our alt-bier with a percentage of barrel-aged stout blended in, our Dopplesticke is now 100% conditioned in barrels to fully complement its substantial caramel malt profile. Abundant whiskey aromatics and spicy flavors blend pleasantly with the delicate esters of this strong ale, resulting in an ambitious balance of beer and spirit. - See more at: http://hangar24brewery.com/co_barrel_tailslide.htm#sthash.e3rJnUSF.dpuf Read Less"

50,Sticke Biscuit,Sierra Nevada Brewing Co.,40,9.8,"Historically brewed for special occasions, a sticke alt is a “secret” stronger version of the German Altbier style. Altbiers are fermented with a unique yeast that blurs the line between ale and lager, striking a delicate balance with assertive malt and hop flavors. Traditionally a neighborhood specialty, old-time Alt breweries would often add their own twist on the style to distinguish it from local competition. We pay homage to that tradition with our variation which we brewed with three different types of biscuit malt and aged in bourbon barrels for six months. The result is a complex amber-hued beer with subtle notes of toffee, baking spice, and toasted sourdough. Read Less"
52,Acceptance,Wild East Brewing Co.,33,5.0,"German-style amber ale brewed with Tettnang hops. Crisp & complex malt with notes of almond, light caramel, sourdough toast & faint cherry-like esters. Moderately-low hop bitterness with a smooth, nutty finish."
56,Maltlanta Doppel Sticke,Wrecking Bar Brewing,50,9.3,"The big brother to our Altlanta Dusseldorf-style Altbier, Maltlanta is a Sticke Altbier brewed to be larger and grander in every way. Rich malt aroma of toffee and biscuits are balanced by a light herbal hop nose coming from the glass. In typical Altbier fashion, the beer is notable for big bright malt notes of caramel and shortbread while finishing crisp and dry for such a large beer. This is a highly refreshing and satisfying brew; you might even forget how big and bad the beer is, so exercise caution"
57,Altimatum,Weathered Ground Brewery,25,5.0,German-Style Altbier brewed with ale yeast at a cooler temperature and then aged cold. Our Altbier is crisp like a lager and plays a balancing act of being not too sweet and not too dry hence the description of being medium bodied. A well made Altbier just hits the spot
58,Bourbon Street Alt,Abita Brewing Company,25,8.5,"Our Bourbon Street Alt is a bourbon barrel-aged Dusseldorf-style Alt beer, brewed with pale and German specialty malts including Munich, Carared, and Melanoidin. It is cold fermented and cold aged to produce a smooth malt flavor. Next, the beer is aged for another eight weeks in small batch bourbon barrels.

Sticke to me! A lager/ale hybrid, this big ol' traditional Altbier Doppelsticke is copper-amber in color thanks to German Pilsner, Munich, and Caramunich malts.

The hordes of emu managed to evade the bulk of the military attack over the six-day period, during which 2,500 rounds of ammunition had been fired and merely a few hundred birds killed. The Great Emu War was crafted in honor of this seemingly spurious encounter.

The resulting beer pours a ruby/blood red hue with a sandy colored head. Dark fruit, red wine, and an earthy/spiced funk are pronounced in the aroma with subtle notes of cherry almond in the back. The flavor is candied dry fruit upfront, with an oak and wine finish. It finishes dry with a slight tartness and medium body. Read Less"

Our recipe was inspired by the traditional refectory ales known as patersbier (“fathers’ beer” in Flemish) in Belgium. These sessionable beers are brewed by the monks for their dinner table and are typically only available at the monastery. Spencer is a full-bodied, golden-hued ale with fruity accents, a dry finish and light hop bitterness. The beer is unfiltered and unpasteurized, preserving live yeast that naturally carbonates the beer in the bottle and keg and contributes to the beer flavor and aroma.

In addition to being the most misquoted line from our favorite space opera…Luke, I Am Your Pater is a Belgian-style patersbier, or single. This style was originally brewed by the monks that needed sustenance without the “enlightenment” that the other bigger Belgian-styles offer.

412,Bishop's Barrel No. 13,Saint Arnold Brewing Company,20,12.0,"The base beer for Bishop’s Barrel No. 13 is, fittingly, Divine Reserve No. 13, our big, but drinkable Quad. BB13 pours a dark brown color with ruby highlights that supports a thin, khaki colored head that dissipates slowly. The high alcohol shows itself visually with legs that stick to the glass when swirled. The aroma brings forth a bouquet of bourbon, vanilla and Belgian yeast characteristics. As it warms, a liquid dessert is brought forth with aromas similar to flan and bananas foster.

The flavor is sweet throughout without being cloying - a palate of sweet, sticky toffee with a nice dark fruit/cherry parfait accompaniment. The barrel shows itself with bourbon and subtle chocolate notes with a soft tannic finish. A full bodied beer with a soft CO2 bite and alcohol that warms the throat without being aggressive.

456,Divine Reserve No. 13,Saint Arnold Brewing Company,26,11.0,"For this Quad, the goal was to go as big as possible while still being as drinkable as any other beer you might pull off the shelf.

The aroma is distinctly Belgian and has a hint of fruit. As with most Belgian beers, the hops are primarily used for bitterness and provide little to no flavor or aroma. We kept the malt bill relatively simple to allow each malt to come through in its own way without getting all muddled together. The caramel and chocolate malts, in particular, work well together and you can taste each of them in the beer. We also added a large amount of Belgian Extra Dark Candi Syrup during fermentation, which darkened the color, imparted dark fruit-like flavors, and boosted the alcohol. Despite its high strength though, the alcohol only comes out as a warmth on the back end but is not over powering. The aftertaste is slightly sweet but also has a dryness that makes you want more.

This beer is best enjoyed at 50°F to 55°F. Read Less"

Rich flavors and aromas of fresh bread, dark fruits, honey and brown sugar are up front with the Belgian yeast strain contributing a punch of spice and fruity esters wafting up with every sip.

German Magnum and Cascade hops impart an earthy, spicy hop character. Hops are definitely not the star of the show here - just enough bitterness and flavor to ensure balance in the finished product. Dextrose and dark Belgian candi sugar boost the sugar concentration and impart a dried fruit character to this huge ale. Chamomile flowers to add to the complex aromas we have already imparted.

475,Fitzcarraldo Barrel Aged Reserve (2016),Breakside Brewery,25,11.2,"In time for Zwickelmania 2016, we are excited to release a special ‘cuvee,’ a special blend of beers created by our brewers. The finished blend is a beer we’ve named Fitzcarraldo. The majority of the blend is a Belgian dark strong ale that spent over 18 months in Bourbon barrels. The extended aging allowed for soft and complex oxidative flavors to come out– there are notes of fig, date, and port. As the beer mellowed, the classic Belgian yeast profile did as well: it shows light notes of clove and red currant. This was blended with a small portion of a Bourbon barrel-aged stout that had spent 12 months in barrels. This beer added some sweetness and richness of body to the blend. Finally, to brighten and enliven the beer, the brewers chose to add a dash of Toro Red, our smoky amber ale. The young beer gives the blend a vibrancy that is uncommon and welcome in a blend of older beers. Read Less"

Rye adds sweetness and complexity to the pilsner and aromatic malts. The spice of the rye is somewhat subdued at lower temperatures but becomes more apparent as the beer warms. Cascade and centennial hops were used for both flavor and aroma, adding floral and citrus notes to play off the strengths of the yeast. Belgian candi sugar was added during fermentation to bump up the alcohol while allowing the beer to avoid finishing too sweet.
