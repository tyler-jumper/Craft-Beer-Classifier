Work on next
- split the types of beers up into the 10 categories
	- Categories aren't acting as expected kind of. There are a ton of IPAs (expected) but VERY few of every other Beer
	- need to look into  this more
 
- I created a Naieve Bays model for the NLP part (used the DS5k nlp notebook as a guide)
	- I started with just determining if a beer is an IPA or not 
	- There were 218 IPAs and I got all the Stouts, Sours, Pale Ales, and Lagers as the 'non_IPAs' (there were about 222)
	- Removed stopwords, non alphanumeric chars, made all  words lowercase, and stemmed all words
	- the accuracy is 88% from a baseline of 48%


ALSO
- should I just do straight up nlp using only the description to see if the model can guess the beer type?
- It would be cool to put all this on Kaggle but I think before I do that I would want to get the full description

What we need to find
- I need to get more of all the other kinds of beers
- and eventually figure out how to do nlp model with multiple outcomes (IPA, Pale ale, Brown Ale, etc) rather than just is it an IPA yes or no
