Work on next
- Eventually down the road introduce SRM as another feature
- split the types of beers up into the 10 categories
    - probably do a style.contains() and then if it contains IPA then it's an IPA rather 
    than all the weird styles of IPAs
- I could potentially give this data to the other (castone) program and see if it cleans it

ALSO
- should I just do straight up nlp using only the description to see if the model can guess the beer type?
- It would be cool to put all this on Kaggle but I think before I do that I would want to get the full description

What we need to find
- We will implement SRM later
