109,45,13.0,"Vanilla WAVES is the second edition to the WAVES series. Here we've taken our Waves base beer and added a significant amount Mexican and Ugandan Vanilla to it.

This isnÃ¢ÂÂt your sticky sweet overly adjuncted stout. What youÃ¢ÂÂre getting here is a throw back with a modern twist.

Aroma: Semi-sweet dark chocolate, soft-vanilla, hit of toffee, followed by strong coffee roast.
Taste: (Front Palate) Big dry semi-sweet chocolate followed by an oily vanilla spice that gives way to subtle caramel sweetness. (Mid Palate) You get a break here from the chocolate and get a pithy almost charcoal dryness, earthiness, and minerality. (Back Palate) Here the dark bitter bakers chocolate pops followed by a burst of coffee roast. As it settles you get a wave of bourbon and barrel burn that dissipates quickly but leaves a lingering semi-sweet chocolate oak stave.

The body is oily and viscous, really holding all the flavors together but allowing you to spend time with them individually.

This will not hit the pastry bois vanilla requirements. The Ugandan and Mexican Vanilla donÃ¢ÂÂt give you that classic bakers vanilla. You get earthy and spicy flavors that one might not place as vanilla. Ugandan vanilla tends to impart big chocolate tones and that is most definitely the case here. The Mexican vanilla gives you a rye spice quality that buts up against some traditional vanilla but only slightly",1,65

112,50,14.0,"I had the privilege of acquiring a Four Roses single barrel, picked and signed for good measure by the legend Al Young himself. When brewing the base recipe of Dimensions of Time, I filled this barrel and let it sit for 27 months. 

The result is a decadent chocolate/bourbon molten cake. This is very much a traditional stout, which is specifically designed to showcase the barrel more than the leftover unfermented sugars (if you know what I mean). Don't expect pastry flavor or pudding viscosity. This stout is for the bourbon aficionados that enjoy a big-bodied stout with tons of naturally occurring chocolate, vanilla, caramel, leather, and bourbon",1,77
113,20,13.0,"With this iteration of WAVES, we tweaked the recipe a little to pull back on the roast and boost the sweetness. Our addition of real Maple Syrup inline on the way to the pasteurizer allowed it to homogenize and spread equally through the beer so each can has a nice balance. What you get with this iteration is a stout that leans a little more towards pastry without significantly overdoing it. As we experiment with the brewing system weÃ¢ÂÂll continue to tweak this recipe to perfection. Join us on the journey.

The aroma is chocolate, maple, and coffee along with the classic stout notes of grist, toffee, and muted vanilla. The first taste is grain sweetness followed by maple sweetness and when it hits the mid-palate you get waves of maple and coffee roast. Because of the addition of Maple you get a lingering sweetness on the back palate. This beer is chewy and thick. You could probably pour it on pancakes and be happy with the result. ?",1,64

It is rare for Bourbon to age in barrels for more than twenty-three years. But these barrels patiently sat for over thirty years. The extra years developed a distinct and complex character that makes them truly one-of-a kind. We filled those barrels with Bourbon County Brand Stout, and then stored them away in our Chicago Barrel House to age for two more years. With these rare barrels from our friends at Heaven Hill we believe this is one of the finest beers we have ever produced. This is Goose Island Rare Bourbon County Brand Stout for 2015.

The crew here at Tree House tastes âchocolate covered maple candyâ, âvanillaâ, âchocolate cakeâ, âbrown sugarâ, and âfresh roasted coffeeâ.

Scatter Signal is an ode to progress, however hampered. To unseen development that is quiet and steady. To unshakable perseverance, even as the ground trembles.

Scatter Signal was forged from the liquid that made Bottle Logic what it is -- our World Beer Cup-clad Darkstar November, here now built and brawned to withstand war. Coffee for vigor, chocolate to fortify, marshmallows for resilience.

This 14.8% ABV Imperial Mocha-Marshmallow Stout is a blend of liquid aged from 12 to 24 months in a medley of our favorite bourbon barrels. It was conditioned on the 'Southern Weather' and 'Monarch' blends of coffee beans roasted by our brothers in arms at Onyx Coffee Lab for a complex foundation of chocolate brownie and burnt sugar undertones.

Cacao nibs bolster the chocolate front -- Ecuadorian nibs were chosen specifically for the nutty, hot-chocolate-like flavors they impart. Marshmallows were our finishing touch; added in abundance for their softly sweet aroma, for a bounce of viscosity, and amidst a very hard year, for the outright joy of it. In the absence of joy, there is nothing worth fighting for.

Our recipe was inspired by the traditional refectory ales known as patersbier (âfathersâ beerâ in Flemish) in Belgium. These sessionable beers are brewed by the monks for their dinner table and are typically only available at the monastery. Spencer is a full-bodied, golden-hued ale with fruity accents, a dry finish and light hop bitterness. The beer is unfiltered and unpasteurized, preserving live yeast that naturally carbonates the beer in the bottle and keg and contributes to the beer flavor and aroma.

The high alcohol shows itself visually with legs that stick to the glass when swirled. The aroma brings forth a bouquet of bourbon, vanilla and Belgian yeast characteristics. As it warms, a liquid dessert is brought forth with aromas similar to flan and bananas foster.

The flavor is sweet throughout without being cloying - a palate of sweet, sticky toffee with a nice dark fruit/cherry parfait accompaniment. The barrel shows itself with bourbon and subtle chocolate notes with a soft tannic finish. A full bodied beer with a soft CO2 bite and alcohol that warms the throat without being aggressive.

683,26,11.0,"For this Quad, the goal was to go as big as possible while still being as drinkable as any other beer you might pull off the shelf.

The aroma is distinctly Belgian and has a hint of fruit. As with most Belgian beers, the hops are primarily used for bitterness and provide little to no flavor or aroma. We kept the malt bill relatively simple to allow each malt to come through in its own way without getting all muddled together. The caramel and chocolate malts, in particular, work well together and you can taste each of them in the beer. We also added a large amount of Belgian Extra Dark Candi Syrup during fermentation, which darkened the color, imparted dark fruit-like flavors, and boosted the alcohol. Despite its high strength though, the alcohol only comes out as a warmth on the back end but is not over powering. The aftertaste is slightly sweet but also has a dryness that makes you want more.

This beer is best enjoyed at 50Â°F to 55Â°F. Read Less",7,4

Rich flavors and aromas of fresh bread, dark fruits, honey and brown sugar are up front with the Belgian yeast strain contributing a punch of spice and fruity esters wafting up with every sip.

German Magnum and Cascade hops impart an earthy, spicy hop character. Hops are definitely not the star of the show here - just enough bitterness and flavor to ensure balance in the finished product. Dextrose and dark Belgian candi sugar boost the sugar concentration and impart a dried fruit character to this huge ale. Chamomile flowers to add to the complex aromas we have already imparted.

687,25,11.2,"In time for Zwickelmania 2016, we are excited to release a special âcuvee,â a special blend of beers created by our brewers. The finished blend is a beer weâve named Fitzcarraldo. The majority of the blend is a Belgian dark strong ale that spent over 18 months in Bourbon barrels. The extended aging allowed for soft and complex oxidative flavors to come outâ there are notes of fig, date, and port. As the beer mellowed, the classic Belgian yeast profile did as well: it shows light notes of clove and red currant. This was blended with a small portion of a Bourbon barrel-aged stout that had spent 12 months in barrels. This beer added some sweetness and richness of body to the blend. Finally, to brighten and enliven the beer, the brewers chose to add a dash of Toro Red, our smoky amber ale. The young beer gives the blend a vibrancy that is uncommon and welcome in a blend of older beers. Read Less",7,4

Ã¢Â Â
In the Fall of 2016, we set forth to brew our first Vermont spontaneous grown beer. We aptly chose Andrew Peterson's farm malthouse that is situated around Boyers Fruit orchard in Monkton. Under the cool night sky where the Vermont wild yeast blows we allowed this dextrin rich wort made from Vermont grown and malted barely, raw wheat from Nitty Gritty Grain of Charlotte, and a touch of aged hops from Homestead Hops of Starksboro settle in for the evening. We followed up with the same process in 2017 where both vintages sat untouched in 500 liter oak barrels. In the fall of 2018 we blended and finished this beer off with Elderberries from @Thorn Hill Farm of Greensboro. Following a final barrel fermentation and aging, we bottle conditioned this beer in the summer of 2019 with BurlingtonÃ¢ÂÂs own BTV honey.
