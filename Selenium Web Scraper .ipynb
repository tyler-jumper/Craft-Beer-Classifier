Brewed with a wide variety of tropical, citrus-forward hops, Dissenter clocks in at 8.7% ABV and 70 IBUs. Our ales are fermented at warm temperatures, but this lager is fermented cold, using a different kind of yeast. The longer brewing process used for lagers gives Dissenter an exceptionally clean finish, allowing you to appreciate the clear beauty of the hops as you would a well thought out, eloquent dissenting opinion. We’ll let this one speak for itself. Read Less \n",

The Notch team has planted a flag in the art of brewing session styles from Europe, while also experimenting with how to introduce American, hop forward flavors into these classic styles. We were honored to be asked to participate in Notch's Guest Brewer initiative and we jumped at the chance to ratchet up our lager pilot brewing efforts with the experienced crew in Salem. The result: \"I Predict A Riot\" an American Pale Lager that marries a soft Citra hop centric aroma and flavor on top of a satisfying lager backbone.\n",

The beer then ferments and ages in French oak wine barrels for roughly two years. To finish, we add fresh, Maine-grown peaches and let the barrels rest for another five months before the beer is ready for bottles. Read Less \n",

To begin, we carefully select a number of oak barrels that have been aging our sour blonde ale for anywhere from several months to several years, and then blend the beers together for the ideal flavor. Once that is achieved, we pile heaps of Hallertau Blanc hops on top to achieve an aromatic blend like no other, inundating the senses with citrusy, tropical, funky and grassy goodness. This is one complex beer, and it’s best consumed fresh. Read Less \n",

      "Description:  We began our sour ale project in 2006 with only four oak barrels previously used to age red wine. The number has grown over the years, along with the amount of sour ale we’ve brewed. Each barrel develops unique characteristics as it ferments independently, and just as Belgian brewers have been doing for centuries, we’ve sought out our favorite barrels, some young, some several years old, for blending. By blending the sour ale from these barrels together in various amounts, we created in this bottle a live harmony of tartness, fruitiness, and layers of flavor that can never be replicated.\n",

      "Description:  Culminate is our first ever blend of turbid mashed 1, 2, and 3 year old spontaneously fermented Lambic-inspired ales design in the spirit of Belgian Gueuze. Every year we put away wine barrels full of Lambic-inspired beer brewed as closely to Belgian tradition as possible. It involves a complex turbid mash process of Pilsner malt and unmalted wheat, a long boil with aged whole leaf hops(aged for over 5 years), natural cooling and inoculation in our rooftop koelschip, and barrel fermentation. The wort is fermented only with the natural yeast and bacteria that land on it overnight while cooling. A portion of the beer in this blend dates back to some of our first brews ever in 2016. Culminate was blended and bottled on February 1, 2019 and conditioned only with the cultures present in the beer.⠀\n",
      "⠀\n",
      "We’ve been looking forward to releasing Culminate since day one and Lambic-inspired beer is at the heart of what we do at The Veil. Even the name of our brewery is a romantic reference to the pellicle that forms on the top of this style of beer while it ages in the barrels and helps protect the beer from oxygen exposure. ⠀\n",
      "⠀\n",
      "We’re extremely happy with the results - Culminate tastes like Lambic with its own Veil personality. The layered flavors of funky fruit, cheesy hops, gentle oak, a bright citrus acid profile, and a pleasant natural carbonation give this beer unrivaled complexity for its strength. Read Less \n",

Our blending methodology for Four Winters is unique when compared to our other beers. We taste through the cellar and select our favorite 6, 18, and 30 month-old spontaneous barrels for blending. We also look for the most promising 18 month-old barrels and earmark them for an additional year of aging so we lay the best possible foundation for the following year’s 30 month-old component.

After the boil, hot wort is pumped into our coolship and cooled overnight, where thriving resident flora from our wild cellar inoculates the wort.

Yes, it's a made up style, but this is craft beer and we don't like to follow the rules all the time. We decided on the style that we did because we used 2-row, 6-row, and both brown and black rice as our base malts. This lends itself to the clean, crisp, and refreshing character associated with a traditional malt liquor. We then used some midnight wheat and black barley to obtain the dark color and slight roast character in the taste. Be careful because Beatbox Samurai is dangerously smooth and will sneak up on you when you least expect it. Read Less \n",

Briefly aged in 2nd generation Bourbon barrels to impart traditional oak-cask flavors; lightly hopped for mild-like drinkability; and made with a mix of bready English malts for an intensely rich flavor. This has quickly become one of our Head Brewer’s favorite beers and we sincerely hope you enjoy it too. Read Less \n",

The nose of this beer is rich in complexity, providing pineapple, dried apricot, raisin and a pleasantly soft muskiness. Toasted oak overtones balance these aromas with a light cedar quality. As the warming alcohol coats the palate a soft vanilla lingers on the tongue imparted by the medium toast virgin oak. Read Less \n",

The sweet potatoes were then put in the 100% Virginia grain mash with local sage. Once transferred to the boil kettle, we added brown sugar.\n",

The waft of smoke provides an earthy taste that connects the malt and molasses with a velvety mouthfeel from the sweet potatoes.

We blended a portion of Papier that had been aging in oak barrels with this new batch of the same beer, adding an additional layer of complexity that will grow over time as we continue to age and blend with each anniversary, creating an older average age to the ale.

This is their description of the beer: Our signature American pale ale balances light, crisp, malt character with an abundance of hop-derived aromatics and flavors from the use of Citra and Columbus. The fragrant nose is fresh citrus, tropical fruit, and peach. Bold flavors of pineapple and mango mix with dank notes of zesty citrus and fresh pine needles. With the smooth mouthfeel, gentle bitterness, and dry finish, Fort Point is our standard daily-drinker. Read Less \n",

Curiosity 26 is built on a sturdy malt base of 2-row, carafoam, and medium crystal providing a deep orange hue and a solid backbone to a supremely hop saturated pale ale! The aroma is potent and citrusy, leading our palates to flavors of orange, mango, and a mixed bouquet tropical fruit. The finish dissolves in a soft mouthfeel and rounded pithy bitterness, vanishing quickly from the pallet and priming the next sip. A real crusher of a Curiosity, indeed! Read Less \n",

We intend to brew Ph0phy again when the new hops land) The hopping rate was moderate on the hot side, and relatively restrained on the dry hop to maintain a delicate, balanced character like those beers enjoyed so much in Australia. Notes of persimmon smoothie, ice cold cucumber slices, lemon tart, fresh cold pressed kiwi juice, and lightly brewed jasmine tea. Read Less \n",

      "Description:  Technique Double Pale Ale uses groundbreaking experimental hops & methods to give you a great aroma and depth. Don't expect a hoppy juice bomb. What grabs you about Technique is waves of smooth pine/forest/sharp red fruitiness, and a very, very special sweet earthiness that defies description. We use odd but great hops indeed! Our one-of-a-kind equipment stews hops in a 170* portion of the FINISHED beer and uses an uber high secondary dry-hopping fermentation pressure of 60 psi with 2 yeast strains....that is a partial glimpse of the unique methods in Technique DPA. Enjoy! Read Less \n",

While not sweet, dark fruit notes, such as cherries, dates, and raisins, reveal themselves as the beer warms. This special batch spent 6 months resting in Buffalo Trace barrels lending additional notes of vanilla, oak, & bourbon. Read Less \n",

The philosophers at Cigar City Brewing have attempted to answer this eternal query by marrying the gourd with the complimentary flavors of Ceylon cinnamon, Jamaican allspice, Zanzibar cloves and nutmeg. The answer presents itself in the bottle of high-gravity complexity you now hold in your hand, and the answer is good. This Imperial Pumpkin Ale was aged in two different types of barrels; half was aged in rum barrels and half was aged in bourbon barrels.\n",

There are notes of nutmeg, caraway and vanilla. The taste starts with chocolate malt with a hint of spice and rolls into a warm spicy alcohol taste which has the effect of creating the balance that usually comes from the hop bitter. There is some hop bitter on the finish, but not much. Overall, this beer finishes relatively dry for such a big beer. As it warms, the spices move forward in the taste and the chocolate moves to the finish. The pumpkin provides a pleasant undertone and a nice mouthfeel.

It is very lightly hopped which showcases the rich caramel tones of the malt body that balances the assertive smoke flavor throughout. Batch 5000 would be a wonderful pairing for robust cheeses, sausages and smoked salmon. While drinkable now, Batch 5000 has an ageing potential of several years. The interplay of flavors will mature and develop subtly with time. Avoid any extreme temperatures, and keep at a cellar temperature below 65 °F. Available on draft at the brewery only. Read Less \n",

Rye malt, used as 50% of the grist provides a rich, smooth mouth-feel with a “spicy” flavor profile. Munich and Crystal malts surround the rye and complement the spiciness with a toffee-like malt sweetness. This ale is fermented with a unique German yeast strain which adds clove flavors to the palate provided by the gallant grain combination. We hope you enjoy this beer as Rabbit Hole Brewing’s RYEteous Knight epitomizes and protects our craft beer mantra for the bold and valorous combination of flavors! Read Less \n",

The rye gives the beer a distinctive sweet flavor and aroma. We used a Bavarian yeast strain that gives the beer banana and bubble gum-like flavors and aromas. We used German Perle hops in very small amounts so the flavors of the rye, wheat, and yeast predominate. This beer is not filtered and cloudy in appearance, but still very refreshing. Read Less \n",

To translate this classic cocktail into a beer, we brewed batches of the base rye beer that received spice additions mimicking bitters as well as lemon peel during the boil.

Even in that arena, it has largely been eclipsed by corn and barley, the sources of bourbon and scotch. But when we procured some seasoned barrels from our friends at Templeton Rye, we asked ourselves, “Why not?” Why not brew a rich, tawny rye ale, then mellow it in the warmth of charred oak rye whiskey casks? Two kinds of malted rye provide spicy sweetness, giving way to notes of caramelized wood and the citrusy tang of Perle, Magnum, and Saphir hops before easing into a dry, lingering finish.

Where it deviates is with the roundness of flavors the bourbon barrel contributes. Vanilla, cinnamon and touch of rich earthy pipe tobacco mix with an alcohol warmth that adds to the rich creaminess. The great thing about this beer is that the barrel aging adds to the whole without taking away the character of the original.\n",

      "Description:  For our fifth anniversary brew we looked to the Highlands of Scotland for inspiration, imagining a beer fit for a king. A traditional Scottish ale fit the bill nicely, featuring rich malt and a subtle smokiness, but not too cloying or heavy for a summer release. Aged for months in both 26-year-old Speyside, single malt Scotch whisky barrels and American oak bourbon barrels, it features an array of flavors while never allowing one note to overpower another. The peat smoke intermingles nicely with the vanilla notes from the bourbon, while toffee, honey, and candied fruit round out the beer. The resulting blend is a delicious dram that we think you’ll enjoy sharing with others. Read Less \n",

      "Description:  A collaboration with Beachwood BBQ & Brewing. For our first local collaboration beer of 2013, we teamed up with our good friends at Beachwood Brewing in Long Beach, CA. We've worked with these folks on a number of small batch brews, beer dinners and general shenanigans for many years and it was really exciting to sit down and work on a full scale project with them for the first time. What we ended up with is an imperial smoked stout, but of course it wasn't that simple. We smoked our own malt on the same smoker and with the same blend of three different woods that Beachwood uses for their award winning BBQ - apple, white oak and pecan. We then aged the beer on those same three types of wood. The resulting stout is hearty and wonderful, balancing the rich, meaty smokiness with the sweetness of the malt. Read Less \n",

Cowbell has bright, bracing acidity along with a soft vinous champagne flavors, culled from the foeder in which it matures.

      "Description:  Imagine yourself in Berlin’s Tiergarten enjoying this refreshing Berliner Weisse inspired beer on a warm summer’s day. Bretta Weisse honors the traditional beverage of the great Prussian capital, Berlin. Fredrick-the-Great was trained to brew it, and Napoleon’s troops called it “The champagne of the North”. Firm estery notes of stone and tropical fruit lead to Funky, yeasty, citrus aromas. Soft cereal and Oak flavors are enveloped by a firm acidity and tartness. The finish is dry and crisp; a thoroughly enjoyable beverage. At 4.9% ABV, one could imagine enjoying several Bretta Weisse’s in the Tiergarten, or anywhere else. This Berliner Weisse inspired Wheat beer was aged in 1700 gal French Oak horizontal foeders for 8 months. Read Less \n",

Originating in style from the Flanders region of Belgium, near the French border, this dark, sour ale has roots deep in brewing history and predates most of the ales that have become popular in contemporary culture. We're doing our best to keep the tradition alive by brewing and aging this beer here on the West Coast. Read Less \n",

      "When our tasting room opens at 4pm on Friday, September 16th, we’ll be releasing 2016 Aurelian Lure — our barrel aged sour beer refermented with apricots!\n",
      "This year, we only have 900 bottles of Aurelian Lure available for sale (500ml/$20). The bottle limit is one per customer per day while supplies last. Aurelian Lure will also be available by the glass. Aside from special events, it will only be available at Jester King.\n",
      "Like 2016 Jester King 分 桃 (Fēn Táo), our batch of Aurelian Lure is small this year. The limiting factor is the amount of mature, barrel aged sour beer we have for blending. Mixed culture fermentation in oak barrels takes up a lot of time and space. Given the size of our barrel room, plus the fact that not all of the beer we ferment works out, we only have so much beer every year to devote to fruit refermentation.\n",
      "This year, we devoted proportionally more mature beer to berries, grapes, and cherries, so stone fruit took somewhat of a back seat. Why? I’d say it’s a mix between our customers by and large having a greater desire for Atrial Rubicite (raspberries), Nocturn Chrysalis (blackberries), and Montmorency vs. Balaton (cherries), and us wanting to do more experiments this year with local grapes. The Texas grape harvest was good to us this year, so we did several new grape refermentation experiments, which took up some of our mature barrel stock. If all goes well, our 2016 grape refermentations will come out late this year. Read Less \n",

This beer contains no actual gin -- our brewmaster carefully hand-picked over a dozen specialty ingredients to mimic the classic flavors of gin, then made it a dirty martini with an addition of olive juice! Like our \"Just Too Likable\" Lemongrass Miso Gose, which relied on the miso for saltiness, this Gose contains no traditional sea salt -- all of the salinity comes from the olive juice. So if you're ready for a drink, Sour, Not Stirred may just hit the spot. Shaking the cans is not recommended! Read Less \n",

There is a very nice malty complexity, along with a beautiful red color. Most of what you get from the various grains can be described as biscuity, nutty, caramel, toffee and very slight roast. Additionally, there is a fullness of body and a slight residual coating effect in the finish that belies the very slight level of residual sugar remaining after the fermentation of this beer. This full body is from the variety of grains we used which lend texture/viscosity. Read Less \n",

      "Description:  This bottle of Double Shot was crafted with the spirit, mood, and nostalgia of the holiday season in mind. To that end, we chose the big-bodied Guatemala Bella Vista to pair with an extra rich base beer. We smell and taste fudgy dark chocolate, cocoa powder, & sweet caramel balanced by a gentle acidity. It drinks almost like lightly effervescent coffee/chocolate liqueur. The perfect beer to cuddle up by the fire with. It is, in our opinion, an example of what is possible with careful selection of ingredients paired with focused brewing execution. Please enjoy this bottle fresh and use it as an opportunity to reflect and give thanks. Read Less \n",

To this end, I brewed Cosmos, the beer, in the style of a robust Foreign Export Stout to have as a companion on those cold, clear nights of celestial exploration. With its big, warm body, rich chocolate and caramel flavors, and delicate oatmeal smoothness, Cosmos stands up to the coldest of New England nights. So whether you’re exploring your inner and outer universe high in the White Mountains or marveling at the night sky through your backyard telescope, Cosmos Stout will help keep your body (to say nothing of your mind) rooted here on Earth.

It is rare for Bourbon to age in barrels for more than twenty-three years. But these barrels patiently sat for over thirty years. The extra years developed a distinct and complex character that makes them truly one-of-a kind. We filled those barrels with Bourbon County Brand Stout, and then stored them away in our Chicago Barrel House to age for two more years. With these rare barrels from our friends at Heaven Hill we believe this is one of the finest beers we have ever produced. This is Goose Island Rare Bourbon County Brand Stout for 2015. Read Less \n",

Lastly bourbon barrel-aged maple syrup from Bissell Maple Farm in Ohio is added which provides complexity to the nutty oats and coffee to round out the flavors, ultimately reminiscent of your breakfast ‘special’ at the local diner.

      "We are pleased to bring you batch 2 of one of our favorite pasty stouts. Life After Death Star is a collaboration with our friends J. Wakefield Brewing that features a long boil to create a thick and decadent base before adding shredded raw coconut, marshmallow, vanilla, and Ghost Bear Espresso Blend coffee from the 2020 Micro Roaster of the year, Mostra Coffee, along with a touch of lactose. Life After Death Star pours a viscous jet black and develops a caramel head upon pouring releasing beautifully balanced notes of deep espresso coffee paired with flavors of fudge, creamy marshmallow, just scrapped vanilla, double chocolate brownie batter, and light coconut throughout. This beer is extremely smooth, luxurious, and creamy. We are extremely pleased with the second batch and it definitely begs the question, “Is batch 1 always better, bro?” Read Less \n",

This beer is the sum of multi-sourced adjuncts and showcases the true art of collaboration. LBDS starts off with the same long boil LADS base before being conditioned on Cacao Nibs from Exquisito Chocolates in Miami Florida graciously selected and shared with us by the JWB Team, our new house Kinetic Energy Blend Coffee that we worked on with our friends at Mostra (more below), Maple Syrup, Marshmallow, and a touch of lactose.\n",

      "Life Before Death Star pours jet black and develops a mocha head with an aroma of maple infused brownie batter and Rolo candies. Flavors of gooey chocolate and maple covered pancakes lead into the thick and viscous mouthfeel of chocolate fudge, vanilla marshmallow and a sweet but balanced addition of maple that is supported by a deep coffee backbone and a touch of cinnamon spice from the complex relationship of Kinetic Energy Blend and Exquisito Cacao nibs. This rollercoaster ride of harmonious flavors finishes thick, smooth, luxurious, and creamy. We are extremely happy with closing out LADSvember with this latest variant. Read Less \n",

      "Description:  Stouts are rarely a style of beer clamored for during the warmer seasons, and not ones to play it safe, we here at Fieldwork Brewing Company decided to deliver what we think is the perfect stout for summer. We developed an Oatmeal Stout with loads of rich cocoa and toasted malt notes to compliment the heaps of hand toasted coconut the beer is aged on. To accentuate the tropical notes of coconut we added in an obscene amount of sea salt which in turn helps cut through the rich oatmeal laden body to help transform what could be considered a dessert beer into a sessionable inky black elixir. Its silky velvet-like body aides in draping the coconut from the front to the back of your tongue, only thinning out as the salt hits the palate, inducing just the slightest amount of salivation, helping this creamy coconut bomb wash clean and keeping it incredibly drinkable for a stout that is darker than the Alaskan sky in winter. Do yourself a favor and enjoy this German Chocolate Cake inspired Stout while soaking in the sun's rays at your favorite beer garden or hunkered down by a fireplace as the cool night hits.

The barrels selected for the final blend were from several batches in the summer of 2015, averaging just over a year in age at blending. We then cold-infused freshly roasted and coffee direct from Dark Nectar. Read Less \n",

The rest of the components fall perfectly in line, backing Velvet Merkin up with luscious caramel complexity and a creamy malt symphony. The final component adds a new twist – the rum barrel-soaked and lean Helldorado makes its Anniversary debut, bringing a fresh splash of island-spice to a ridiculously balanced barrel-aged brew. This is one of those times that the whole truly equals more than the sum of its parts. I couldn’t be happier with the result.\n",

The beer was brewed in batches; some was fermented on oak, some was fermented normally, and some was allowed to sour in the mash tun before being transferred to a fermenter. Batches were then blended until desired levels of wood and tartness were achieved for the final product.\n",

We elevate the traditional Dunkelweizen to the next level with the addition of rye and other specialty malts, building on the rich flavor profile. Our brewers then aged the beer in barrels formerly used to mature rye whiskey. With the first sip, you’ll discover the fruity and spicy nature of the Weizen yeast, but the finish is where the rye barrels shine—peppery and intense with a touch of vanilla flavor for a truly unique beer.

Fresh and young, the aromatics are still classic and soft, but the palate is vibrant with our citrusy/lemony acidity. With age, the oak and a more classic Side Project depth will showcase and round the palate.\n",

      "Description:  Inspired by a trip to Belgium and designed to resemble the character of lambic found in the town of its namesake, Train to Beersel showcases a slightly higher ABV than you’ll find in most other lambics. As such, the body of the beer is more pronounced, adding a certain roundness to the sour notes while elevating the customary level of funk. Additional complexity is derived from extensive aging in once used French Oak Cabernet Sauvignon barrels and once used American Oak Sauvignon Blanc barrels, and by utilizing the time-honored tradition of bottle conditioning with Brettanomyces Lambicus. It’s an inviting combination that’s full of nuanced turns - and an excursion that’s rarely replicated on this side of the globe. Read Less \n",

      "Description:  To create this cuvee, we tapped into native Somerset Wild, a proprietary wild yeast used solely by Wild Beer Co. at their facility in England. Sunrise Raspberries and a youthful batch of Bretta Weisse were aged in French Oak Foeders. This aromatic concoction was then blended with a mystical fermentation of French candied violet petals and Somerset Wild Saison. The resulting potion is bursting with aromas of ripe fresh fruit and hints of botanical spice. All anchored together with an expressive native wild yeast. A quenching acidity and lively carbonation round out the collaboration. Sante! Read Less \n",
