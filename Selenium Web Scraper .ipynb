      "Description:  One Key is a new brand family that we're debuting! The Saison version is first up! These are double fruited blends that will always include apricots. Apricots and peaches or nectarines go together so well, but they're rarely available at the same time during harvest. If a brewer, like us, wants to use them together and not use puree or extracts, we must first ferment the beer on apricots and then on another stone fruit like peaches or nectarines. So that's what we did. We took choice barrels of Saison and fermented them on organic apricots at a rate of over 3 pounds per gallon. After a month, we transferred this onto organic peaches at a rate of over 3 pounds per gallon as well. The result is a sour juice bomb unlike anything we've ever released \n",

      "Description:  Super Typhoon is a rendition of Hurricane that features amplified additions of Simcoe and Citra in both the kettle and the dry hop. Additionally, process modifications make for a fuller bodied base beer capable of absorbing the additional hop charges without becoming abrasive or astringent. The result is perhaps our favorite amalgamation of hops in our short history. We taste heavy notes of tropical fruit and passion fruit from the Simcoe blending seamlessly with orange sherbet notes from the Citra. An airy mouthfeel and a creamy body makes for a beer that never becomes burdensome to drink, and gets better as you move through the glass. We are excited to share it with you \n",

It is crafted with a simple malt bill and fermented with clean American Ale yeast to create a flavor profile that is more a function of its vibrant fresh ingredients than an expression of yeast character. Bright w/Citra’s aroma is a citrus explosion. The taste follows suit with notes of orange juice, grapefruit, and tangerine with a gentle finish.

It is intended to coax sweet hop candy flavors from a blend of citrus forward American hops paired with our house yeast. Saturated flavors of orange starburst, sweet tangerine, lychee, and unfiltered fresh squeezed orange juice play nicely with a gently carbonated body lending to a beer that is intensely enjoyable and eminently drinkable. Our house yeast provides juicy fruit gum and melon overtones throughout. It’s a Super Treat, indeed \n",

Hop bitterness is not particularly intense, which leads to a very drinkable, juicy IPA even non-IPA fans love. The Haze is not from yeast, but rather from an interplay of lipids from the malted oat and oils and acids which naturally occur in the hand selected Dry hops. This beer is a perfect interplay between top grade malt and hops, MI water and brewing technique which cannot be faked \n",

      "Description:  As we all know, Paul died in a car accident in 1966 and was replaced by a young lookalike named Billy Shears, often referred to as Faux Paul or simply \"Faul.\" This was a calculated move by the surviving members, their manager, and MI6, who enjoyed the distraction that Beatlemania provided. The band retired from public performance and entered their \"Studio Years\" period reluctantly acceding to this deception, but guilt overcame them, and they began leaking hints of the truth in hidden backward recordings and album cover art. John even sang, \"Here's another clue for you all, the Walrus is Paul\" (the walrus being the Scandanavian avatar of death.) The question isn't \"Who is Paul?\" we know that it's been decades after all, and Faul has been Paul longer than Paul was Paul, and certainly, Faul has been Paul longer than Billy was Billy. The question is, \"WHAT is Paul?\" a man from Liverpool, or an idea?\n",

Customers developed the habit of asking for them by the tax ratings, or shilling names. The 80-shilling style was one of the stronger types that could be purchased, containing 4.0-5.5% alcohol.\n",
      "\n",
      "The 80-shilling beers are traditionally malty, without much hop character, as hops did not grow in Scotland and were expensive to import. Our Tartan Ale is crafted by Head Brewer Jonathan Reeves. It has a deep, copper-color and is produced in the 80-shilling style. It offers a slightly fruity flavor that complements the luscious malty roast caramel flavor and faint hop aroma. The limited production Tartan® Ale is our Spring Seasonal beer \n",

This single hop ale uses an experimental US hop currently known as ADHA 1940 that has spicy and floral characteristics – much like the Noble hops of Germany and the Czech Republic. Like a weekend outing on Beach Drive, this golden ale is easy going and refreshing \n",

This lager is served unfiltered, or in zwickel style, and is naturally carbonated. Port City’s Kellerbier maintains these brewing traditions.

Subtly sweet pilsner malt and herbaceous noble hops leave room for expressive Belgian yeast character to shine. In the glass, fruity esters and peppery phenols mingle with a floral-herbal hop aroma, setting the stage for a deceptively dry body. Ideaal Tripel is perfectly suited to accompany a wide range of food, such as Thanksgiving dinner, fruit-based desserts, and soft-ripened cheeses \n",
