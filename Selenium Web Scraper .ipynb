But rather than brew just one, we decided to each brew our own unique take. Think of it as a call and response. Whispers and Rumours.\n",

After primary fermentation, we let the beer condition in stainless steel for six weeks — giving Rumours plenty of time to mature and mellow.\n",

      "Description:  Historically brewed for special occasions, a sticke alt is a “secret” stronger version of the German Altbier style. Altbiers are fermented with a unique yeast that blurs the line between ale and lager, striking a delicate balance with assertive malt and hop flavors. Traditionally a neighborhood specialty, old-time Alt breweries would often add their own twist on the style to distinguish it from local competition. We pay homage to that tradition with our variation which we brewed with three different types of biscuit malt and aged in bourbon barrels for six months. The result is a complex amber-hued beer with subtle notes of toffee, baking spice, and toasted sourdough. Read Less \n",

      "Description:  On this 10-year mark, Midnight Sun Brewing Company proudly releases its 1000th batch of beer - a larger-than-life Belgian-style Barley Wine (if such a style exists) simply called M - in commemoration of the enduring spirit that founded and sustains this little brewery in the extreme Northwest. Making M required a massive grain bill - seven seductive malts - boosted by strength-inducing Belgian candi sugar. Once original gravity hit 37 Plato, a frenzied fermentation ensued: four completely fabulous yeast strains, two of Belgian origin, transformed this sweet concoction into all that is beer. But not just any beer. A beer of madcap magnitude - 11.6% ABV. Character and complexity increased exponentialy while M meddled and mellowed for several months in all-American bourbon oak barrels. Blending the aged beer before bottling ascertained smoothness. M is mesmerizing, pouring dark and silky. Caramel and spice waft up from the glass; bourbon, molasses, leather and vanilla follow. The first taste proffers tobacco, burnt sugar and raisin with a sublime port-like finish, but bourbon - smooth, sensuous, brooding bourdon - is ever-present. The finish, a bit edgy like an American take on barley wine, provides the necessary leap toward overall balance. M is a precious gift to ourselves as well as you, seekers of beer-that-is-beyond-beer adventures... We are but mere mortals in the presence of M. Read Less \n",

Now, a new hybrid has formed at Oakshire as our Brewmaster work with Anne Amie Vineyards to create this beer/wine hybrid. We used Anne Amie's classic Muller Thurgau grapes and artfully blended it with a Belgian Golden Ale and matured it with Brettanomyces in Anne Amie's Pinot Noir barrels for a year.

Brewed differently every year to commemorate our anniversary, this year's Fluxus is a strong golden ale brewed with a mix of barley and spelt, and spiced with both green and pink peppercorns. It was lightly hopped using Northern Brewer, Cascade and Saaz varieties. It was then fermented with with a yeast indigenous to the northern region of Belgium.\n",

The medium body gives way to a subtle malt presence and dry finish, with a surprising residual sweetness and a mild peppery heat. Read Less \n",

      "The aroma is distinctly Belgian and has a hint of fruit. As with most Belgian beers, the hops are primarily used for bitterness and provide little to no flavor or aroma. We kept the malt bill relatively simple to allow each malt to come through in its own way without getting all muddled together. The caramel and chocolate malts, in particular, work well together and you can taste each of them in the beer. We also added a large amount of Belgian Extra Dark Candi Syrup during fermentation, which darkened the color, imparted dark fruit-like flavors, and boosted the alcohol. Despite its high strength though, the alcohol only comes out as a warmth on the back end but is not over powering. The aftertaste is slightly sweet but also has a dryness that makes you want more.\n",

The finished blend is a beer we’ve named Fitzcarraldo. The majority of the blend is a Belgian dark strong ale that spent over 18 months in Bourbon barrels. The extended aging allowed for soft and complex oxidative flavors to come out– there are notes of fig, date, and port. As the beer mellowed, the classic Belgian yeast profile did as well: it shows light notes of clove and red currant. This was blended with a small portion of a Bourbon barrel-aged stout that had spent 12 months in barrels. This beer added some sweetness and richness of body to the blend. Finally, to brighten and enliven the beer, the brewers chose to add a dash of Toro Red, our smoky amber ale. The young beer gives the blend a vibrancy that is uncommon and welcome in a blend of older beers. Read Less \n",

      "Description:  The goal of this beer was to make a Belgian/American hybrid using west coast American hops and rye to emulate the fruit and spices often found in Belgian beers. The beer pours a bright golden color. The nose is a mixture of phenolics from the Belgian wit yeast and light citrus from the American hops with a touch of graininess. Rye adds sweetness and complexity to the pilsner and aromatic malts. The spice of the rye is somewhat subdued at lower temperatures but becomes more apparent as the beer warms. Cascade and centennial hops were used for both flavor and aroma, adding floral and citrus notes to play off the strengths of the yeast. Belgian candi sugar was added during fermentation to bump up the alcohol while allowing the beer to avoid finishing too sweet. The dry finish hides the 10% alcohol nicely and makes you want to take another sip. This beer is best enjoyed at 50°F to 55°F. Read Less \n",

The result is a golden belgian strong ale with a pleasant aroma of semi-sweet Riesling grapes and fresh green hops, complemented by a touch of tartness that is quickly cut by a bright, dry finish reminiscent of a refreshing white wine.

Brewed to be bold and aged in our barrel cellar for a year, this is a rich variation on a stellar beer style: weizenbock. We took all those gooey, chocolatey, bready, vanilla, banana and spice flavors found in the German-style wheat bock beer and imperialized them. We then rammed everyting into a full-bodied bourbon barrel embrace, catapulting flavors of vanilla, caramel and coconut. Believe us when we say, once you Ride That Goat, you'll never go bock.
