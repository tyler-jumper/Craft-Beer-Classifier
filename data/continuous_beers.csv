4,Bishop's Barrel No. 17,Adambier,30,13.2,"Adambier Aged in Bourbon Barrels

Bishop’s Barrel No. 17 pours a mahogany color with ruby highlights. It is a slightly hazy beer with pronounced toffee and honey aromas, and chocolate when it's cold. The smoke from the base beer is subtle, and as it warms up, it becomes more in balance with the rest of the flavors. The wood character blends well with the smoked malt.

The whiskey plays the supporting role in this beer. At first sip, the honey and chocolate are well balanced, with the whiskey finishing it off. This is indeed a dessert beer. The smoke provides just enough to balance the sweetness. Perfectly paired with a bar of chocolate smothered in toffee and honey, next to the fire while wearing your finest velvet smoking jacket.

17,Deacon's Nightcap,Barleywine - English,33,10.5,"Deacon’s Nightcap is a collaboration between Figueroa Mountain and the Maltose Falcons homebrew club. Founded in 1974, the Maltose Falcons are the oldest homebrew club in California. The club was active in the 1978 in efforts to legalize homebrewing in the state of California. The current club continues to be recognized as one of the premier homebrewing clubs in the US and produces outstanding quality beer.
Adambier is a rare style that tastes like a cross between an English Barley wine and a doppelbock. What should you look for in an Adambier? Malt, malt, and more malt. Just as a big Belgians will showcase esters and yeast complexity, and a double IPA displays the hops, an Adambier defines complex maltiness. The malt is caramelized and roasty, but those flavors come with a long boil and fermentation, not with the use of roast or caramel malts. The recipe for this collaboration is based on the club’s Vice President, John Aitchison’s infamous homebrew version. Read Less"

Altbiers are fermented with a unique yeast that blurs the line between ale and lager, striking a delicate balance with assertive malt and hop flavors. Traditionally a neighborhood specialty, old-time Alt breweries would often add their own twist on the style to distinguish it from local competition. We pay homage to that tradition with our variation which we brewed with three different types of biscuit malt and aged in bourbon barrels for six months. The result is a complex amber-hued beer with subtle notes of toffee, baking spice, and toasted sourdough. Read Less"

412,Bishop's Barrel No. 13,Belgian Quadrupel,20,12.0,"The base beer for Bishop’s Barrel No. 13 is, fittingly, Divine Reserve No. 13, our big, but drinkable Quad. BB13 pours a dark brown color with ruby highlights that supports a thin, khaki colored head that dissipates slowly. The high alcohol shows itself visually with legs that stick to the glass when swirled. The aroma brings forth a bouquet of bourbon, vanilla and Belgian yeast characteristics. As it warms, a liquid dessert is brought forth with aromas similar to flan and bananas foster.

The flavor is sweet throughout without being cloying - a palate of sweet, sticky toffee with a nice dark fruit/cherry parfait accompaniment. The barrel shows itself with bourbon and subtle chocolate notes with a soft tannic finish. A full bodied beer with a soft CO2 bite and alcohol that warms the throat without being aggressive.

Paying homage to our Trappist brethren in Belgium with our own interpretation of the style, this big, boozy, robust beer is brewed with rich caramel and roasted malts, Belgian candi sugar, and our house Belgian yeast. After months of resting and maturing in brandy barrels, it now displays an array of flavors while maintaining a nice balance throughout. The brandy’s unique characteristics perfectly compliment this bold beer, with notes of dried cherries, figs, raisins, and toffee intermingling with a subtle warmth in the finish. Read Less"

The aroma bursts with baked cherries soaked in bourbon. You’ll taste notes of honey, maple syrup, toffee, and graham cracker.

456,Divine Reserve No. 13,Belgian Quadrupel,26,11.0,"For this Quad, the goal was to go as big as possible while still being as drinkable as any other beer you might pull off the shelf.

The aroma is distinctly Belgian and has a hint of fruit. As with most Belgian beers, the hops are primarily used for bitterness and provide little to no flavor or aroma. We kept the malt bill relatively simple to allow each malt to come through in its own way without getting all muddled together. The caramel and chocolate malts, in particular, work well together and you can taste each of them in the beer. We also added a large amount of Belgian Extra Dark Candi Syrup during fermentation, which darkened the color, imparted dark fruit-like flavors, and boosted the alcohol. Despite its high strength though, the alcohol only comes out as a warmth on the back end but is not over powering. The aftertaste is slightly sweet but also has a dryness that makes you want more.

This beer is best enjoyed at 50°F to 55°F. Read Less"
459,Uncalled Four,Belgian Quadrupel,32,13.5,"Barreal Aged version of our 4th Year Beer, or “Quadruple,"" which is inspired by the traditional Trappist strong ales produced in the abbey breweries of Belgium. Brewed with Pilsner, Munich, and Caramunich malts, the resulting beer has a deep chestnut hue. Rich flavors and aromas of fresh bread, dark fruits, honey and brown sugar are up front with the Belgian yeast strain contributing a punch of spice and fruity esters wafting up with every sip.

German Magnum and Cascade hops impart an earthy, spicy hop character. Hops are definitely not the star of the show here - just enough bitterness and flavor to ensure balance in the finished product. Dextrose and dark Belgian candi sugar boost the sugar concentration and impart a dried fruit character to this huge ale. Chamomile flowers to add to the complex aromas we have already imparted.

475,Fitzcarraldo Barrel Aged Reserve (2016),Belgian Strong Dark Ale,25,11.2,"In time for Zwickelmania 2016, we are excited to release a special ‘cuvee,’ a special blend of beers created by our brewers. The finished blend is a beer we’ve named Fitzcarraldo. The majority of the blend is a Belgian dark strong ale that spent over 18 months in Bourbon barrels. The extended aging allowed for soft and complex oxidative flavors to come out– there are notes of fig, date, and port. As the beer mellowed, the classic Belgian yeast profile did as well: it shows light notes of clove and red currant. This was blended with a small portion of a Bourbon barrel-aged stout that had spent 12 months in barrels. This beer added some sweetness and richness of body to the blend. Finally, to brighten and enliven the beer, the brewers chose to add a dash of Toro Red, our smoky amber ale. The young beer gives the blend a vibrancy that is uncommon and welcome in a blend of older beers. Read Less"

The beer pours a bright golden color. The nose is a mixture of phenolics from the Belgian wit yeast and light citrus from the American hops with a touch of graininess. Rye adds sweetness and complexity to the pilsner and aromatic malts. The spice of the rye is somewhat subdued at lower temperatures but becomes more apparent as the beer warms. Cascade and centennial hops were used for both flavor and aroma, adding floral and citrus notes to play off the strengths of the yeast. Belgian candi sugar was added during fermentation to bump up the alcohol while allowing the beer to avoid finishing too sweet. The dry finish hides the 10% alcohol nicely and makes you want to take another sip. This beer is best enjoyed at 50°F to 55°F. Read Less"

Friendship is like brewing… always a creative collaboration.

This complex, yet drinkable beer is a blend of pale ale and stout. The aroma is a combination of hop from the pale ale with roasted notes and just a hint of smoke from the stout. The rounded body of the beer starts with sweetness from the caramel malt in the pale ale and finishes with aggressive roasted fullness of the stout.

After three days of open fermentation, we dry-hop this warm-fermented lager with fresh whole-cone hops in a closed tank to maximize the hop aromas.

Here he set out to build the Union Brewery - which would quickly grow to be one of the largest, most prolific breweries in the Region. Sadly, ten years later a fire claimed the brewery beyond repair. Lucky for us his famous Steam-beer recipe didn't burn up with it! On a history binge at the city archives one afternoon, we stumbled upon this historic recipe and set out to brew it once again. With a bright, earthy flavor from Sacramento native Cluster hops and a slightly sweet, nutty character from roasted barley, we think you'll love this little trip through history! Read Less"

A truly unique, 100% American Style Lager, the history of this style goes back well over a hundred years to the mid 1800’s. Brewed with TN barley, malted in North Carolina by River Bend Malt, Common Ground is a tawny colored, toasty, malted delight, with a fairly dry and crisp finish from rustic American hops. Read Less"

1847,Chicha,Corn Beer / Chicha de Jora,4,3.1,"Spit happens - and when it does, you brew Chicha. An ancient Peruvian beer brewed with corn that’s chewed up and spit out, Chicha is one of our most talked about brewing creations.

So what exactly is Chicha? In Peru, small communities produce it from masticated maize, naturally fermented in large clay pots and often flavored with indigenous fruit and spices. Here at Dogfish Head, we reproduced the ancient beer by creating Chicha from co- worker masticated purple Peruvian corn, malted corn and malted barley. The wort is then boiled for full sterilization, chilled and blended with strawberries. Fermented with a unique blend of yeast strains, Chicha clocks in at 3.1% ABV with fruity, spicy aromas and a dry finish.

We've been brewing this ancient beverage since 2009 and this year, we enlisted the help of 100+ co-workers to prepare the beer's main ingredient - masticated purple maize ... and for the first time, we released 200 (750ml) bottles of this one-of-a-kind brew exclusively at our Milton Tasting Room & Kitchen on Saturday, March 10, 2018.

We chose these two particular grape varietals due to the contrasting nature of the fruit. According to our Head Brewer Averie Swanson, “We wanted to create a blend that exhibited the darker fruit and pepper notes of the Syrah with the brighter cherry and more perfumey character of the Sangiovese.

The 2016 edition of Transatlantique Kriek began life in the oaken vessels of Gert Christiaens’ Oud Beersel, a 130-year-old Belgian lambic brewery. After time spent aging in wood, Oud Beersel’s lambic was blended with tart cherries and shipped across the Atlantic to New Belgium.
Clear, ruby red stained glass, fluffy pink cotton candy foam.
Cherry pie filling and pastry, almonds and vanilla, berry jam, raspberries, hibiscus, green apple.
Fruity sweetness, quickly joined by light bright tartness.
Sprizty, mouthwatering, SweetTart candy chalky.
The lager and sour beer is then mixed with the cherry lambic at a ratio of 50% kriek, 25% sour Felix, and 25% golden lager. Morello Cherries: Too sour for some people's tastes to be eaten fresh. The beer’s malty sugars balance the acidity and brings out the fruit's aroma and flavor.

We decided on the style that we did because we used 2-row, 6-row, and both brown and black rice as our base malts. This lends itself to the clean, crisp, and refreshing character associated with a traditional malt liquor. We then used some midnight wheat and black barley to obtain the dark color and slight roast character in the taste.

The Reinheitsgebot is the German purity law stating beer must be made using only water, malt, hops, & yeast. Early German immigrant brewers had to throw this rule out the window in order to brew beer with ingredients on hand, i.e. Cheap corn, rice & poor quality barley. This year we teamed up with Bierstadt Lager of Denver Colorado to brew this classic German-style Pilsner using all American ingredients including Crystal hops from the Hop Head Farms in Michigan & California grown, floor malted grain from Admiral Maltings of Alameda, CA & releasing it on the 504th anniversary of the Reinheitsgebot, April 23, 2020, bringing glory back to the American made lager.

The nose is pumpkin spice up front with oak, bourbon, vanilla and dark fruit in the background. The taste starts with sweet chocolate and pumpkin spice up front and finishes with a bit of alcohol heat and spices. This beer has a medium-full body with a soft mouthfeel. BB9 was aged in both Woodford Reserve and Willett bourbon barrels and blended prior to packaging.

6081,Good Gourd Have Mercy,Pumpkin / Yam Beer,23,12.2,"Since man began pondering the great mysteries of the universe, one question has persisted: is the pumpkin, the most obtuse of the gourds, inherently good in nature? The philosophers at Cigar City Brewing have attempted to answer this eternal query by marrying the gourd with the complimentary flavors of Ceylon cinnamon, Jamaican allspice, Zanzibar cloves and nutmeg. The answer presents itself in the bottle of high-gravity complexity you now hold in your hand, and the answer is good. This Imperial Pumpkin Ale was aged in two different types of barrels; half was aged in rum barrels and half was aged in bourbon barrels.

This beer has been retired.

6274,Wicked Fist,Red Ale - Imperial / Double,70,9.5,"This huge red ale is a collaboration with our friends at Wicked Weed Brewing Co. in Ashville, NC, brewed here in Chicago!

We utilized Pale Malt as the base and an assortment of unique caramelized grains from Germany and Chile along with Malted Carolina Rye from a small artisan producer in North Carolina called Riverbend Malt House. In the brew kettle we hit it with Apollo, Citra, Crystal and Chinook hops for bittering, flavor and there amazingly bright citrus aromas.

In an attempt to bring the hop aroma up to another level we dry-hopped this beer in the fermentation tank with Crystal, Chinook and Cascade, very traditional old-school aroma hops.

The resulting ale has a beautiful red hue with layers of caramel malt character and an undertone of spicy, earthy grain flavor from the malted rye with a clean crisp bitterness and huge punch of floral and citrus aromas and a hint of fresh pine! Read Less"

The RYEteous Knight from Rabbit Hole Brewing showcases a lesser known, but very bold, classic German beer style, the Roggenbier. Rye malt, used as 50% of the grist provides a rich, smooth mouth-feel with a “spicy” flavor profile. Munich and Crystal malts surround the rye and complement the spiciness with a toffee-like malt sweetness. This ale is fermented with a unique German yeast strain which adds clove flavors to the palate provided by the gallant grain combination. We hope you enjoy this beer as Rabbit Hole Brewing’s RYEteous Knight epitomizes and protects our craft beer mantra for the bold and valorous combination of flavors! Read Less"

Even in that arena, it has largely been eclipsed by corn and barley, the sources of bourbon and scotch. But when we procured some seasoned barrels from our friends at Templeton Rye, we asked ourselves, “Why not?” Why not brew a rich, tawny rye ale, then mellow it in the warmth of charred oak rye whiskey casks? Two kinds of malted rye provide spicy sweetness, giving way to notes of caramelized wood and the citrusy tang of Perle, Magnum, and Saphir hops before easing into a dry, lingering finish. Read Less"

The flavors and aromas of the base beer are true to the Divine Reserve No. 4. It is filled with caramel, toffee, dried figs, cocoa and a slight peatiness. Where it deviates is with the roundness of flavors the bourbon barrel contributes. Vanilla, cinnamon and touch of rich earthy pipe tobacco mix with an alcohol warmth that adds to the rich creaminess. The great thing about this beer is that the barrel aging adds to the whole without taking away the character of the original.

The warmer this beer gets the better it tastes. We recommend enjoying between 55°F and 60°F. Read Less"

While this is one of the more classic beer styles that we make, it’s not a style that you can find too often in the United States. Originating in style from the Flanders region of Belgium, near the French boarder, this dark, sour ale has roots deep in brewing history and predates most of the ales that have become popular in contemporary culture. We’re doing our best to keep the tradition alive by brewing and aging this beer here on the west coast.

Beginning in 2015, Oude Tart is part of the portfolio of Bruery Terreux. Read Less"

Additionally, there is a fullness of body and a slight residual coating effect in the finish that belies the very slight level of residual sugar remaining after the fermentation of this beer.

It is rare for Bourbon to age in barrels for more than twenty-three years. But these barrels patiently sat for over thirty years. The extra years developed a distinct and complex character that makes them truly one-of-a kind.

7691,Good Morning,Stout - Imperial / Double,65,8.4,"A project that began as Imperial Double Shot has matured into a distinct beer that is perhaps our most complex yet! Brewed with Monson’s own Maxwell Road Maple Grade A Dark Amber Maple syrup, Good Morning pours pitch black in the glass with a creamy mousse-like head. The bubbles give way to aromas of rich milk chocolate, cocoa powder, and dark amber maple syrup. The flavor starts as a blast of milk chocolate, sweet maple syrup, and rich fresh coffee as deeper complexities are uncovered as it warms. The crew here at Tree House tastes “chocolate covered maple candy”, “vanilla”, “chocolate cake”, “brown sugar”, and “fresh roasted coffee”. Refined, richer, and more integrated, batch number two rocks our world. A super decadent treat, Good Morning begs to be shared and contemplated! Read Less"

7893,Scatter Signal (2020),Stout - Imperial / Double Pastry,40,14.8,"Let your plans be dark and impenetrable as night...

Scatter Signal is an ode to progress, however hampered. To unseen development that is quiet and steady. To unshakable perseverance, even as the ground trembles.

Scatter Signal was forged from the liquid that made Bottle Logic what it is -- our World Beer Cup-clad Darkstar November, here now built and brawned to withstand war. Coffee for vigor, chocolate to fortify, marshmallows for resilience.

This 14.8% ABV Imperial Mocha-Marshmallow Stout is a blend of liquid aged from 12 to 24 months in a medley of our favorite bourbon barrels. It was conditioned on the 'Southern Weather' and 'Monarch' blends of coffee beans roasted by our brothers in arms at Onyx Coffee Lab for a complex foundation of chocolate brownie and burnt sugar undertones.

Cacao nibs bolster the chocolate front -- Ecuadorian nibs were chosen specifically for the nutty, hot-chocolate-like flavors they impart. Marshmallows were our finishing touch; added in abundance for their softly sweet aroma, for a bounce of viscosity, and amidst a very hard year, for the outright joy of it. In the absence of joy, there is nothing worth fighting for.

In the middle, our two favorite stouts, Parabola and Velvet Merkin, work in concert to provide a dusty cocoa mocha aroma and bitter dark chocolate flavors, reminiscent of Bourbon-soaked chocolate chip cookie dough. Double DBA brings its signature vanilla-infused crème brulée flavor and Helldorado brings balance with honey notes and light leather nuances. A dash of Wookey Jack offers fresh hop notes creating even more complexity. XVII is full of soft chocolate and warm spice perfectly balanced by toasted coconut, bourbon barrel notes and smooth creamy malt mellowness. XVII is best enjoyed in a half-filled brandy snifter or red wine glass. Allow it to warm to 55F to fully enjoy the complex aromas and flavors.

Helldorado, with flavors of lavender and honey liqueur fold in flowery notes and DDBA delivers its signature American toasted oak, English caramel toffee and light leather nuances. Stickee Monkee lends rich maple syrup, spicy cinnamon, and ripe fig flavors while Bravo adds barrel character and bourbon notes. The addition of Wookey Jack adds wily citrusy hop notes and spicy rye backbone. As this beer sits and breathes in the glass, more rich dusty chocolate, stone fruit and crème brulee characters are revealed as the rich spirit character fades. Read Less"

8397,Firestone 21 (XXI) Anniversary Ale,Strong Ale - American,28,11.8,"This year’s Anniversary beer is a magical blend of five components. Chocolatey, mild Velvet Merkin takes the lead setting the stage full of lush malt and barrel driven texture, yet tempered alcohol strength. The rest of the components fall perfectly in line, backing Velvet Merkin up with luscious caramel complexity and a creamy malt symphony. The final component adds a new twist – the rum barrel-soaked and lean Helldorado makes its Anniversary debut, bringing a fresh splash of island-spice to a ridiculously balanced barrel-aged brew. This is one of those times that the whole truly equals more than the sum of its parts. I couldn’t be happier with the result.

This beer is unfiltered and unfined, so there will be a small amount of sediment in the bottom of the bottle. XXI is best enjoyed poured carefully into a half-filled brandy snifter or wine glass. Allow it to warm to 55F to fully enjoy the pleasing and complex aromas. As the beer sits and breathes in the glass the true complexity of this blend is revealed, so take your time. If you wait to open your bottle later, store it in a cool dark place. Like our other Anniversary offerings, this beer will age well and change favorably for years to come. It was an absolute pleasure in the making and I truly hope you enjoy our 12th oak-aged blend! The journey continues.

This beer is dedicated to all of the new mothers and fathers within the FW Family and to their little ones who are our future.

English hop varieties contribute subtle herbal, peppery qualities. The beer was brewed in batches; some was fermented on oak, some was fermented normally, and some was allowed to sour in the mash tun before being transferred to a fermenter. Batches were then blended until desired levels of wood and tartness were achieved for the final product.
